Lecture Outline: The Upanishads

Central Questions of the Upanishads:

What is your real Self?

What is the nature of ultimate reality?

Central Metaphysical Claim:  Atman = Brahman

Two different interpretations of this claim: the ocean metaphor vs the actor metaphor.

(Qualitative vs quantitative identity)

What is it like to “try on” this worldview as you move through your day?

Why believe A = B?

The testimony of people who claim to have achieved enlightenment through meditation.

How To Live:  The path of pleasure vs the path of joy

To pursue pleasure is to also pursue pain.

Pleasures are caused by external objects or circumstances.

Two reasons why pleasure and pain go together:

Joy: internal source; undirected; intense and peaceful at the same time.

Joy is billions to the pennies of pleasure.

How to achieve lasting joy: (1) and (2)

Are the claims of the Upanishads empirically testable?

Yes, in principle, but not by methods currently in use.  

You have to decide what to devote your life to from a position of ignorance and uncertainty.

In the meantime, you can try meditation and see if it improves your condition in the short term.
