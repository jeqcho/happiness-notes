Lecture Outline: The Bhagavad Gita

There are many different paths to enlightenment; it is possible to combine a serious quest for spiritual enlightenment with active participation in the world of human affairs.

What is essential to these different paths is loss of self (the superficial self, not the Atman).

This conflicts with common ideas about (1) identity and (2) self-worth.

Work as Meditation:  Whatever you do, try to give it your full attention.  Avoid multi-tasking.  Work with focus and concentration, without distraction.

Why?  It’s more enjoyable, more effective, and a step toward loss of self and enlightenment.

Two obstacles, both caused by distractions: split attention; monkey mind

Two common sources of distraction: (1) Worrying about the outcome (2) Rushing.  Avoid both.

Why work this way?  Three possible reasons:

(1) It’s a step toward enlightenment; (2) It’s more enjoyable; (3) It’s more effective

An intriguing possibility: The extent to which we enjoy something and find it satisfying depends more on how deeply we are able to absorb ourselves in it than on the kind of activity it is.  The quality of attention that we are able to bring to the task matters more than the kind of task it is. 

Another Recommendation: Cultivate detachment from reward / outcome of work.  You should not be motivated by reward, nor upset if you fail.

Chapter 6 of the Gita, Verse 1: “It is not those who lack energy or refrain from action but those who work without expectation of reward who attain the goal of meditation.”

(Another kind of loss of self – loss of selfishness.  Loss of concern with your own well-being at the exclusion of others’ well-being.)

(Role obligations.)
