Lecture Outline: Epictetus, The Handbook

How to live well?  (1) and (2)

Four different justifications for (2)

What is up to you and what is not?  Is Epictetus right about this?

If he’s not, does that totally undermine his view?  What is salvageable?

Managing Desire:

How to deal with unsatisfied desire.  You want something, and you don't have it.

Is trying to satisfy the desire always (sometimes, never) the best solution?

What is the Stoic solution to desire?

Examples - bath, Olympics

“I want not only to bathe, but to keep my mind in a state conformable to nature.”

Slavery and Freedom:

Who is the true slave?  Who is the true master?  Who is truly free, and who is truly enslaved?

Many have found this to be an inspiring ideal.  Epictetus promises complete invulnerability.

Is it really possible?  Is it really desirable?

And is this approach cruel and uncaring when applied to others?

Reply: Most others are not even trying to be Stoics, and even those who are are far from ideal.  In fact, for now, they cannot help being vulnerable to our actions.  So treat them well.
