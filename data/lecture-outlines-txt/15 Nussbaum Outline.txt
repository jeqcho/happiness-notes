Happiness Gen Ed 1025
Professor Susanna Rinard, Fall 2025

Lecture Outline: Martha Nussbaum on Capabilities and Human Flourishing:

Central Notions: Tragedy and Dignity (zoo animals)

A Central Question: What is this person actually able to do and to be?

Some Central Human Capabilities:

Bodily health, including reproductive health
Emotions (disagreement with the Stoics)
Affiliation
Play
Etc.

To prevent someone from developing these capabilities is to violate their human dignity.  A situation in which someone lacks the resources for developing them is a tragedy.

These capabilities “Exert a moral claim that they should be developed.”


Incommensurability:

We cannot make up for the lack of one capability by supplying more of another.



Objection to life satisfaction theories of happiness / well-being / quality of life:

Adaptive preferences.



Objection to hedonistic theories of happiness / well-being / quality of life:

Bad pleasures and good pains.
