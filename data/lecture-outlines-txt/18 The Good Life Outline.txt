Happiness Gen Ed 1025
Professor Susanna Rinard, Fall 2025

Lecture Outline: The Good Life, Bob Waldinger and Marc Schulz

“The good life is joyful... and challenging.  Full of love, but also pain.  It includes turmoil, calm, lightness, burdens, struggles, achievements, setbacks, leaps forward, and terrible falls…. Life, even when it’s good, is not easy ….  And of course, the good life always ends in death.”

The Harvard Study of Adult Development: 

Followed two groups of young men – via regular extensive interviews and questionnaires – throughout their entire adult lives.

“The longest in-depth longitudinal study of human life ever done.”

Upshot: Flourishing is complicated.  But good relationships make a bigger difference than wealth, career success, fame, etc.  So, you should prioritize strengthening relationships.  (Does this follow?)
