Lecture Outline: The Pali Canon

Four Noble Truths:

There is suffering.  (The Disease)
Suffering is caused by desire.  (The Cause)
To eliminate suffering, eliminate desire.  (The Cure)
The Eightfold Path is the way to eliminate desire.  (The Path)

(1) There is suffering.

Different versions of this claim.  Buddhism: Recurring suffering is inevitable until nirvana.

Claim: Internalizing this enables you to suffer less.  How, why?  Is this right?

(2) Suffering is caused by desire.

Wanting something you don’t have can be a source of frustration, dissatisfaction, discontent, etc.

Objection: It’s not the wanting that’s the problem; it’s the not having.  Reply: Having would not solve the problem.  Suggestion: Perform your own experiments to test these claims.

Objection: Desire is the cause of some suffering, but not all.  Example: physical pain.

Reply: The two darts of suffering.  Clarify dukkha – “suffering” perhaps not the best translation.

(3) To eliminate suffering, eliminate desire.

Objection: If I eliminate desire, I will do nothing.  I will die.

Reply: Distinguish attachment (clinging/craving) vs mere preference (disposition/project/plan).

Practice non-clinging – letting go of (releasing) thoughts / emotions.  Experiment.  Does it help?

Resistance and aversion are also problematic.  Releasing, freeing, not pushing away.

Step 1: Notice.  Step 2: Practice letting go.  It takes time to get the hang of it.

Ideal: The mind is like a calm, still lake.  Does not dwell on hatred, injustice, fear, anxiety.

Start by loosening the weaker attachments, and avoid cultivating additional attachments.

Meditation Experiments:  (Don’t Cling.  Don’t Push Away.  Don’t Ignore.)  (The Six Nails.)
