Happiness Gen Ed 1025
Professor Susanna Rinard, Fall 2025

Lecture Outline: Bentham, Mill, Darwin

What did Bentham, Mill, and Darwin each think about (1), (2), and (3)?

Which principles govern human motivation – what determines how we act, what we do?

What is the nature of happiness – what is the greatest good, the summum bonum?

What determines right and wrong – morally right and morally wrong action?

Jeremy Bentham: 

(1) Humans have “two masters,” pleasure and pain 
(2) Happiness is pleasure (hedonism, like Epicureans)
(3) The greatest happiness for the greatest number is what we are morally required to pursue.

Objections to Bentham on (1)

John Stuart Mill: Rejects Bentham’s answer to (1), agrees on (3), mostly agrees on (2) but with an important modification: higher and lower pleasures

Questions for Mill’s view about “higher” and “lower” pleasures:

Can we sensibly distinguish pleasures of the body from pleasures of the mind?
Are the pleasures of eating, and having sex, animalistic in a problematic way?
Is there only one type of pleasure from eating, and only one type of pleasure from sex?
Is it true that people with experience of both choose “higher” over “lower” pleasures?

Charles Darwin: Disagrees with Bentham about (1); we don’t know his views on (2) and (3).

Other people have tried using evolutionary theory to answer (2) and perhaps (3).

Objections:

Counterexamples (e.g. infanticide in the case of twins)
Natural selection is normatively blind

Why are we here?

Descriptive: What is the causal-historical story of how we came to be?
Normative: What are we here for; what is our purpose?

You can’t infer one from the other.
