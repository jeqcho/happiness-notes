Lecture Outline: Dan Haybron, The Pursuit of Unhappiness

Your external environment, in particular the culture you live in, plays a large role in influencing how happy you are.  The pursuit of happiness may be more a societal, than an individual, matter.  Holding fixed the society they live in, there may be little an individual can do to substantially improve their happiness.

Bentham and Mill - Both far too simple.  Happiness is complex, has at least three dimensions:

Endorsement

Engagement

Attunement

Cognitive vs affective affirmation:

Cognitive affirmation – to respond cognitively to one’s life as if things are going well

Psychic (emotional) affirmation – to respond emotionally to one’s life as if things are going well

Haybron: Happiness is psychic affirmation.  The aggregate of one’s moods and emotions should be broadly positive.

Cognitive and emotional affirmation can come apart.

Compression: 

What is it?  How much of your life do you want to live like this?

FOMO and compression

Quantity vs quality – doing as much as possible vs getting the most out of what you do

“Junk” activities

Central vs peripheral affective states

Are the three dimensions of happiness incommensurable?
