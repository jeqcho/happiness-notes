Happiness Gen Ed 1025
Professor Susanna Rinard, Fall 2025

Lecture Outline: Aristotle, The Nichomachean Ethics

Should you pursue happiness?  

Aristotle: You should pursue eudaimonia.  Flourishing.  This is not a feeling, not a mental state.

Eudaimonia is fulfilling your distinctively human function, or purpose, in an excellent way.

So Aristotle’s question is not “How can I feel good?” but “What is my purpose in life?”

How to determine the function of anything, according to Aristotle: kind, essence, etc.

Apply this to people.  The result: Living in accordance with reason.

This has two parts: (1) Excelling in the activity of reasoning; (2) Performing the actions that reason recommends.  This is the greatest good – the summum bonum – for a human being.

Objection 1: Does this devalue capacities we share with other living things?
Objection 2: Is reason the capacity unique to humans?  Two ways this could fail.
Objection 3: You are a member of many different kinds.

Alternative conceptions of function/purpose:

What your maker intended you to do
Your evolutionary “function”
Developing capabilities and fulfilling your potential, but having a broader and richer conception than Aristotle of what these capabilities are (Martha Nussbaum)

A second key Aristotelian idea: Living well involves cultivating arete (virtue/excellence).

Arete as the mean between deficiency and excess.  

But not the arithmetic mean.  You have to have good judgment.

The challenge here is not in seeing that excellence lies between two extremes, but rather, in actually becoming excellent.

How to do this?

A good upbringing is necessary.  Then, practice, practice, practice, as with the lyre.

Emulate exemplars.
