Lecture Outline: The Happiness Problem, Sam Wren-Lewis

The Control Strategy:

If I work hard enough, I can get the things on my list.  
Once I do achieve them, then I will be happy and secure.  
So, I should devote all my energy to getting these things.

Sam:  These are all incorrect.  Insecurity is an inescapable feature of the human condition.

Areas in which we are insecure:

Also: “In simply trying to achieve everything on our list, we fail to see what really matters.” p. 6

How much of your life do you want to spend inside your problem-solving bubble?

The Understanding Strategy:

Accept your insecurity.  Spend some time trying to understand yourself, others, and the world.

How to figure out what matters?  An ongoing process of both discovery and creation.

Laurie Santos on finding purpose.  Life Review.

At some point, you have to stop searching and make a commitment.

Commitment: The risks and rewards

Examples: Marriage, Children, Challenging Projects

*Without commitment, we risk missing out on the deepest sources of joy and meaning.
*But with commitment, we will have to endure difficulties, and we risk failure.

Self-compassion as the appropriate response to failure.

*Compassion for others helps in understanding them: We need to look beyond moral judgment.

Conclusion:

The control strategy is about “going to war with reality.”
The understanding strategy is about “striving for peace with reality.”

Control is useful only as a means to an end.  If we fail, we have nothing.  
Understanding has intrinsic value.
