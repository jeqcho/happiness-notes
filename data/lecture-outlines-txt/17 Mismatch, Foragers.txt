Lecture Outline: What can we learn from our evolutionary past?

Idea: The modern world we have created for ourselves is an “unnatural” environment for Homo sapiens, and that’s the source of much of our suffering and unhappiness.

Six reasons why this idea is overly simplistic / misleading / flawed:

(1)
(2)
(3)
(4) 
(5)

How did human foragers actually live?

We don’t know.  Our best evidence suggests:

(1) Highly social, rarely alone, same close family and friends for life

(2) Egalitarian Social Structure

(3) Shared Childcare

(4) Mixed-Age Playgroups; No School

(5) No Division of Labor, except by sex (but not “traditional” gender roles)

(6) Female Autonomy and Power (Hadza)

(7) Short workweek

Were foragers happier than members of modern industrialized societies?  We don’t know.

What can we learn from foragers about how to live?  Perhaps some elements of (1) – (7).

Flexibility, Adaptability, and Creativity are the essence of our species.  We can continue experimenting with different ways of living – some inspired by foragers, some radically new.
