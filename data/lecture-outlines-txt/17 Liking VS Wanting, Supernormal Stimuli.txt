Lecture Outline: Living vs Wanting and Supernormal Stimuli

Liking vs Wanting:

Seriously consider the possibility that these may often diverge: Motivation and Enjoyment.

(1) You have false beliefs about what you actually enjoy.

(2) Liking (enjoying) vs Wanting (being inclined to do it, having an urge to do it)

It is logically possible for these to come apart.  They are conceptually distinct.

We have evidence that in many species including humans, they do come apart.

According to current best-supported theories in neuroscience, one system in the brain controls wanting, and a separate one controls liking.  These two systems involve different parts of the brain, different pathways, and different neurotransmitters.

“Addiction” happens when these are misaligned.  

A person can become addicted in this way to drugs, gambling, junk food.  Other examples?

Another problem: The divergence of motivation and long-term well-being, or what you value.

Supernormal Stimuli:

Examples in Animals:



Do supernormal stimuli create divergences between wanting and liking?

Do people respond to supernormal stimuli in the way that animals do?

If so, do supernormal stimuli create problems for humans, and if so, what kind?
