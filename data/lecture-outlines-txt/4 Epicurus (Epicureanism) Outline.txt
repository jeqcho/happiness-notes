Lecture Outline: Epicureanism

Three theses of the Epicureans: Physicalism, Atheism, Hedonism

Four Main Ideas:

(1) What is the best way to pursue pleasure (and the absence of pain)?

Not this way:

This way: Seek freedom from pain in the body and pain in the mind.

Do this by satisfying the basic needs of the body and mind.  They are few and easy to satisfy.

The result – ataraxia.  A deliciously enjoyable, calm, tranquil, deeply peaceful state of mind.

But: Is it really so easy to satisfy the basic needs of the body and mind?

How easy it is will depend a lot on what kind of society you live in.

(2) Recommendation: Do not pursue fame, power, wealth.

Why?  Because: (1) What you have to do to pursue them is stressful; (2) You probably won’t get them, and even if you do, you’ll be anxious about losing them; (3) You’ll get spoiled.

(3) Friendship is Golden

Don’t waste your time pursuing great fame, power, wealth, etc.  Instead, invest in close, supportive friendships.  They provide more long-term security than material riches.

To what extent does the success of this strategy depend on the culture you are living in?

(4) Death is Nothing.  

Death cannot harm you because while you are alive it is not there, and when you are dead you are not there to be harmed.  Objection: You’ll miss out.  Reply:
