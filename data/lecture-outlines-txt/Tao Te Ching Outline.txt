Lecture Outline: Tao Te Ching

The way to live?  Three sentences.  Wu wei.  Work with, rather than against, natural tendencies.

The ineffability of the Tao.

Freedom

There is an emphasis on freedom, as opposed to following precise rules.  Trying to follow precise rules yourself, and imposing precise rules on others, can often backfire.

Avoid “pushing” for something in ways that are confrontational, crude, overly simplistic.

Intrinsic vs Extrinsic Motivation; The Contrarian Impulse; Examples

We may not be convinced by the idea that simple rules and pushing are always a bad idea.  But perhaps what the Taoist is saying is not this, but rather that we too often default to this approach when better, more skillful approaches are available.

How to influence things skillfully?

Understanding Before Action.  Steering rather than pushing.  

Passivity.  Responsiveness.  Don’t cling rigidly to preconceived notions of how things operate.

“The way is gained by daily loss.”  E.g. loss of unhelpful intense emotions like fear and anger.

Hide

Influence in an inconspicuous way – influence without being seen to influence – and in a way that minimizes tension and conflict.

Objection: Problematically manipulative?   Reply:

Pleasure

Unlike most texts we have read so far, there is no denigration of bodily pleasures.  Just avoid attachment and desensitization.  “Knowing when enough is enough is enough.”

The Pursuit of Happiness: Be skeptical of overly simplistic approaches.  Wu Wei is effortless and enjoyable; avoids struggle, conflict.  An easy life of flowing gracefully through the world.
