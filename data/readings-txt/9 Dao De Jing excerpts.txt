At rest is easy to hold. 
Not yet impossible is easy to plan. 
Brittle is easy to break. 
Fine is easy to scatter.
Create before it exists.
Lead before it goes astray .
A tree too big to embrace
Is born from a slender shoot.
A nine-storey tower
Rises from a pile of earth. 
A thousand-mile journey
Begins with a single step.
Act and you ruin it.
Grasp and you lose it.
Therefore the Sage
Does not act
Wu wei
And so does not ruin
Ku wu pai
Does not grasp
And so does not lose. 
People commonly ruin their work
When they are near success.
Proceed at the end as at the beginning
And your work won’t be ruined.
Therefore the Sage
Desires no desires
Prizes no prizes
Studies no studies
And returns
To what others pass by . 
The Sage
Helps all beings find their nature,
But does not presume to act.

Shang shan jo shui
Best to be like water,
Which benefits the ten thousand things
And does not contend.
It pools where humans disdain to dwell,
Close to the tao.
Live in a good place.
Keep your mind deep.
Treat others well.
Stand by your word.
Make fair rules.
Do the right thing.
Work when it’s time.
Only do not contend,
And you will not go wrong.


15
The ancients who followed tao:
Dark, wondrous, profound, penetrating,
Wei, miao, hsüan, t’ung,
Deep beyond knowing.
Because they cannot be known,
They can only be described.
Cautious,
Like crossing a winter stream.
Hesitant,
Like respecting one’s neighbors.
Polite,
Like a guest.
Yielding,
Like ice about to melt.
Blank,
Like uncarved wood.
Open,
Like a valley .
Mixing freely ,
Like muddy water.
Calm the muddy water,
It becomes clear.
Move the inert,
It comes to life.
Those who sustain tao
Do not wish to be full. 
Because they do not wish to be full
They can fade away
Without further effort.


22
Ch’ü tse ch’üan
Crippled becomes whole,
Crooked becomes straight,
Hollow becomes full,
Worn becomes new ,
Little becomes more,
Much becomes delision.
Therefore Sages cling to the One
And take care of this world;
Do not display themselves
And therefore shine;
Do not assert themselves
And therefore stand out;
Do not praise themselves
And therefore succeed;
Are not complacent
And therefore endure;
Do not contend
And therefore no one under heaven
Can contend with them. 
The old saying
Crippled becomes whole
Is not empty words.
It becomes whole and returns.


29
Trying to control the world?
I see you won’t succeed. 
T’ien hsia shen ch’i
The world is a spiritual vessel
And cannot be controlled.
Those who control, fail. 
Those who grasp, lose. 
Some go forth, some are led,
Some weep, some blow flutes,
Some become strong, some superfluous,
Some oppress, some are destroyed.
Therefore the Sage
Casts off extremes,
Casts off excess,
Casts off extravagance. 


35
Chih ta hsiang
Hold the great elephant
—The great image—
And the world moves.
Moves without danger
In safety and peace.
Music and sweets
Make passing guests pause,
But the tao emerges
Flavorless and bland.
Look—
Y ou won’t see it.
Listen—
Y ou won’t hear it.
Use it—
Y ou will never use it up.


41
The great scholar hearing the tao
Tries to practice it.
The middling scholar hearing the tao,
Sometimes has it, sometimes not.
The lesser scholar hearing the tao
Has a good laugh. 
Without that laughter
It wouldn’t be tao.
Therefore, these sayings:
The bright road seems dark, 
The road forward seems to retreat,
The level road seems rough. 
Great te seems hollow .
Great purity seems sullied.
Pervasive te seems deficient.
Established te seems furtive.
Simple truths seem to change.
The great square has no corners.
The great vessel is finished late. 
The great sound is scarcely voiced. 
The great image has no form. 
tao hides, no name.
Tao yin wu ming
Y et tao alone gets things done. 


76
Humans are born soft and weak.
They die stiff and strong.
The ten thousand plants and trees
Are born soft and tender,
And die withered and sere. 
The stiff and strong
Are Death’s companions
The soft and weak
Are Life’s companions. 
Therefore,
The strongest armies do not conquer,
The greatest trees are cut down.
The strong and great sink down.
The soft and weak rise up. 
Jou jo ch’u shang


78
Nothing in the world is soft and weak as water.
But when attacking the hard and strong
Nothing can conquer so easily . 
Weak overcomes strong,
Soft overcomes hard. 
Everyone knows this,
No one attains it. 
Therefore the Sage says:
Accept a country’s filth
And become master of its sacred soil.
Accept a country’s ill fortune
And become king under heaven. 
True words resemble their opposites.
