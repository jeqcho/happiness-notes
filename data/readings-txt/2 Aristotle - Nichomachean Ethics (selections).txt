This is why a ybuA is not a suitable student of pohti^al science; for he 
lacks experience of th^'«^ons in life, which are the^bject and premises 
of oiur arguments. §6 Moreover, since he tendS'to follow his feelings, his 
study will be futile and useless; for the^eifd [of political science] is action, 5 
not knowledge.* §7 It does not m^ei; whether he is young in years or 
immature in character, since^th^aeficiency does not depend on age, but 
results from following hjs'f^lings in his fife and in a given pursuit; for an 
immature person^^ike an incontinent person, gets no benefit from his 
knowledge. Bupf6i those who accord with reason in fdrming their desires 10 
and in their-^ctions, knowledge of political science will be of great benefit.
§8^TTiese are the preliminary points about the student, about the way 
our^lahns are to be accepted, and about what we propose to do.*
[Common Beliefs]
Let us, then, begin again.* Since every sort of knowledge and decision* 
pursues some good, what is the good that we say political science seeks? 15 
What, [in other words,] is the highest of all the goods achievable in 
action?
§2 As far as its name goes, most people virtually agree; for both the 
many and the cultivated call it happiness, and they suppose that living 
well and doing well are the same as being happy* But they disagree 20 
about what happiness is, and the many do not give the same answer as 
the wise.*
§3 For the many think it is something obvious and evident—for 
instance, pleasiure, wealth, or honor. Some take it to be one thing, others 
another. Indeed, the same person often changes his mind; for when he has 
fallen ill, he thinks happiness is health, and when he has fallen into pov­
erty, he thinks it is wealth. And when they are conscious of their own 
ignorance, they admire anyone who speaks of something grand and 25 
above their heads. [Among the wise,] however, some used to think that 
besides these many goods there is some other good that exists in its own 
right and that causes all these goods to be goods.*
§4 Presumably, then, it is rather futile to examine all these beliefs, and 
it is enough to examine those that are most current or seem to have some 30 
argument for them.
§5 We must notice, however, the difference between arguments from 
principles and arguments toward principles.* For indeed Plato was right 
to be puzzled about this, when he used to ask if [the argument] set out 
from the principles or led toward them*—^just as on a race course the path 1095b 
may go from the starting line to the far end,* or back again. For we should
3


Book I, Chapter 4 §5 ARISTOTLE
1095b certainly begin from things known, but things are known in two ways;* 
for some are known to us, some known without qualification. Presum­
ably, then, we ought to begin from things known to us.
5 §6 That is why we need to have been brought up in fine habits if we
are to be adequate students of fine and just things, and of political ques­
tions generally. §7 For we begin from the [belief] that [something is 
true]; if this is apparent enough to us, we can begin without also [know­
ing] why [it is true].* Someone who is well brought up has the begin­
nings, or can easily acquire them.* Someone who neither has them nor 
10 can acquire them should listen to Hesiod:* 'He who grasps everything 
himself is best of all; he is noble also who listens to one who has spoken 
well; but he who neither grasps it himself nor takes to heart what he hears 
from another is a useless man.'

[The Three Lives]
But let us begin again from the point from which we digressed.* For, it 
would seem, people quite reasonably reach their conception of the good, 
15 i.e., of happiness, from the lives [they lead]; §2 for there are roughly 
three most favored lives: the lives of gratification, of political activity, and, 
third, of study*
The many, the most vulgar, would seem to conceive the good and hap­
piness as pleasure, and hence they also like the life of gratification. 
20 §3 In this they appear completely slavish, since the life they decide on is 
a life for grazing animals.* Still, they have some argument in their 
defense, since many in positions of power feel as Sardanapallus* felt, [and 
also choose this life].
§4 The cultivated people, those active [in politics], conceive the good 
as honor, since this is more or less the end [normally pursued] in the 
political life. This, however, appears to be too superficial to be what we 
25 are seeking;* for it seems to depend more on those who honor than on the 
one honored, whereas we intuitively believe that the good is something 
of om own and hard to take from us.* §5 Finther, it would seem, they 
pursue honor to convince themselves that they are good; at any rate, they 
seek to be honored by prudent people, among people who know them, 
30 and for virtue. It is clear, then, that—in their view at any rate—virtue is 
superior [to honor].
§6 Perhaps, indeed, one might conceive virtue more than honor to be 
the end of the political life. However, this also is apparently too incom­
plete [to be the good]. For it seems possible for someone to possess virtue 
1096a but be asleep or inactive throughout his life, and, moreover, to suffer the 
worst evils and misfortunes. If this is the sort of life he leads, no one 
would count him happy, except to defend a philosopher's paradox.*
4


Enough about this, since it has been adequately discussed in the popular I096a 
works* as well.
§7 The third life is the life of study, which we shall examine in what 5 
follows.*
§8 The moneymaker's life is in a way forced on him [not chosen for 
itself];* and clearly wealth is not the good we are seeking, since it is 
[merely] useful, [choiceworthy only] for some other end. Hence one 
would be more inclined to suppose that [any of] the goods mentioned 
earlier is the end, since they are liked for themselves. But apparently they 
are not [the end] either; and many arguments have been presented 10 
against them.* Let us, then, dismiss them.

'{The Platonic Form of the Good]
Presumably, though, we had better examine the universal good, andpuz- 
zle outhvhat is meant in speaking of it.* This sort of inquiry is^Tdoe sure, 
imwelcometo us, because those who introduced the Forms^;*\fere friends* 
of ours; stiiPsh presumably seems better, indeed only^htght, to destroy 15 
even what is close to us if that is the way to preserve truth. We must espe­
cially do this as plnlosophers, [lovers of wisdom]; for though we love 
both the truth and our^friends, reverence is due to the truth first.
§2 Those who intro^ced this view did ndt mean to produce an Idea 
for any [series] in which they spoke of prior and posterior [members];* 
that was why they did not mean to establish an Idea [of number] for [the 
series of] numbers. But the good is spoken of both in what-it-is [that is, 20 
substance], and in quality and relative;* and what exists in its own right, 
that is, substance, is by nature prior to the relative,* since a relative would 
seem to be an appendage and coincident of being. And so there is no com­
mon Idea over these.
§3 Further, good is spoken of in as many ways as being [is spoken of]:* 
in what-it-is, as god ^d mind;* in quality, as the virtues; in quantity, as the 25 
measured amoui^ in relative, as the useful; in time, as the opportune 
moment; in plape, as the [right] situation; and so qn. Hence it is clear that 
the good carafot be some common and single universal; for if it were, it 
would be spoken of in only one [of the types of] predic^on, not in them all.
§4 Further, if a number of things have a single Idea, There is also a sin- 30 
gle science of them; hence [if there were an Idea of good] there would also 
be ^me single science of all goods. But, in fact, there are m^ny sciences 
even of the goods under one [type of] predication; for the science of the 
pporhme moment, for instance, in war is generalship, in disease medi­
cine. And similarly the science of the measmed amount in food is medi­
cine, in exertion gymnastics. [Hence there is no single science of the good, 
and so no Idea.] \

\§14 Perhaps, however, someone might think it is better^o get to know I096b 
the with a view to the goods that we can possess and achieve in 1097a 
action; fbr^one might suppose that] if we have this a»n sort of pattern, we 
shall also krtow better about the goods that ar^oods for us, and if we 
know about thehi^ we shall hit on them. This argument certainly
has some plausibilily^^but it would seem clash with the sciences. For 5 
each of these, though ibaims at some good and seeks to supply what is 
lacking, leaves out knowledge of thd Idea; but if the Idea were such an 
important aid, surely it would nobpe reasonable for all craftsmen to know 
nothing about it and not even to look for it.
§16 Moreover, it is a puzzle to know what the weaver or carpenter 
will gain for his own craft from knowing this Good Itself, or how anyone 10 
will be better at ipedicine or generalship from having gazed on the Idea 
Itself. For what the doctor appears to consider is not evep health [univer­
sally, let alotie good universally], but human health, and presumably the 
healththis human being even more, since he treats one ^ai;ticular 
patieht at a time.*
y^ much, then, for these questions.
7
[An Account of the Human Good]
But let us return once again to the good we are looking for, and con- 15 
sider just what it could be.* For it is apparently one thing in one action or 
craft, and another thing in another; for it is one thing in medicine, another 
in generalship, and so on for the rest. What, then, is the good of each 
action or craft? Surely it is that for the sake of which the other things are 
done; in medicine this is health, in generalship victory, in house-building 20 
a house, in another case something else, but in every action and decision 
it is the end, since it is for the sake of the end that everyone does the other 
actions.* And so, if there is some end of everything achievable in action, 
the good achievable in action will be this end; if there are more ends than 
one, [the good achievable in action] will be these ends.*
§2 Our argument, then, has followed a different route to reach the 
same conclusion.* But we must try to make this still more perspicuous.* 25 
§3 Since there are apparently many ends, and we choose some of them 
(for instance, wealth, flutes, and, in general, instruments) because of 
something else, it is clear that not all ends are complete.* But the best 
good is apparently something complete. And so, if only one end is com­
plete, the good we are looking for will be this end; if more ends than one 
are complete, it will be the most complete end of these.* 30
§4 We say that an end pursued in its own right is more complete than 
an end pursued because of something else, and that an end that is'never 
choiceworthy because of something else is more complete than ends that
r
7


Book I, Chapter 7 §4 ARISTOTLE
1097a are choiceworthy both in their own right and because of this end. Hence 
an end that is always choiceworthy in its own right,* never because of 
something else, is complete without quahfication.
§5 Now happiness, more than anything else, seems complete without 
1097b qualification.* For we always choose it because of itself,* never because of 
something else. Honor, pleasure, imderstanding, and every virtue we cer­
tainly choose because of themselves, since we would choose each of them 
even if it had no further result; but we also choose them for the sake of 
5 happiness, supposing that through them we shall be happy* Happiness, 
by contrast, no one ever chooses for their sake, or for the sake of anything 
else at all.
§6 The same conclusion [that happiness is complete] also appears to 
follow from self-sufficiency. For the complete good seems to be self-suffi­
cient.* What we coimt as self-sufficient is not what suffices for a solitary 
10 person by himself, living an isolated life, but what suffices also for par­
ents, children, wife, and, in general, for friends and fellow citizens, since a 
human being is a naturally political [animal].* §7 Here, however, we 
must impose some limit; for if we extend the good to parents' parents and 
children's children and to friends of friends, we shall go on without limit; 
but we must examine this another time. Anyhow, we regard something as 
15 self-sufficient when all by itself it makes a life choiceworthy and lacking 
nothing; and that is what we think happiness does.
§8 Moreover, we think happiness is most choiceworthy of all goods, 
[since] it is not coimted as one good among many* [If it were] coimted as 
one among many* then, clearly, we think it would be more choiceworthy 
if the smallest of goods were added; for the good that is added becomes 
an extra quantity of goods, and the larger of two goods is always more 
20 choiceworthy.* Happiness, then, is apparently something complete and 
self-sufficient, since it is the end of the things achievable in action.*
§9 But presumably the remark that the best good is happiness is 
apparently something [generally] agreed, and we still need a clearer 
statement of what the best good is.* §10 Perhaps, then, we shall find 
25 this if we first grasp the fimction of a human being. For just as the good, 
i.e., [doing] well, for a flautist, a sculptor, and every craftsman, and, in 
general, for whatever has a function and [characteristic] action, seems to 
depend on its fimction,* the same seems to be true for a human being, if a 
human being has some function.
30 §11 Then do the carpenter and the leather worker have their functions
and actions, but has a human being no function?* Is he by nature idle, 
without any function?* Or, just as eye, hand, foot, and, m general, every 
[bodily] part apparently has its function, may we likewise ascribe to a 
human being some function apart from all of these?*
§12 What, then, could this be? For living is apparently shared with 
1098a plants, but what we are looking for is the special function of a human
8


NICOMACHEAN ETHICS Book I, Chapter 7 §20
being; hence we should set aside the life of nutrition and growth.* The life 
next in order is some sort of Ufe of sense perception; but this too is appar­
ently shared with horse, ox, and every animal.*
§13 The remaining possibility, then, is some sort of life of action* of 
the [part of the soul] that has reason.* One [part] of it has reason as obey­
ing reason; the other has it as itself having reason and thinking.* More­
over, life is also spoken of in two ways [as capacity and as activity], and 
we must take [a human being's special function to be] life as activity, 
since this seems to be called life more fully* We have found, then, that 
the human function is activity of the soul in accord with reason or requir­
ing reason.*
§14 Now we say that the function of a [kind of thing]—of a harpist, for 
instance—is the same in kind as the function of an excellent individual of 
the kind—of an excellent harpist, for instance. And the same is true with­
out qualification in every case, if we add to the function the superior 
achievement in accord with the virtue; for the function of a harpist is to 
play the harp, and the function of a good harpist is to play it well.* More­
over, we take the human function to be a certain kind of life, and take this 
life to be activity and actions of the soul that involve reason; hence the 
fxmction of the excellent man is to do this well and finely.
§15 Now each function is completed well by being completed in 
accord with the virtue proper [to that kind of thing].* And so the human 
good proves to be activity of the soul in accord with virtue,* and indeed 
with the best and most complete virtue, if there are more virtues than 
one.* §16 Moreover, it must be in a complete life.* For one swallow 
does not make a spring, nor does one day; nor, similarly, does one day or 
a short time make us blessed and happy.
§17 This, then, is a sketch of the good; for, presumably, we must draw 
the outline first, and fill it in later.* If the sketch is good, anyone, it seems, 
can advance and articulate it, and in such cases time discovers more, or is 
a good partner in discovery. That is also how the crafts have improved, 
since anyone can add what is lacking [in the outline].
§18 We must also remember our previous remarks, so that we do not 
look for the same degree of exactness in all areas, but the degree that 
accords with a given subject matter and is proper to a given line of 
inquiry* §19 For the carpenter's and the geometer's inquiries about the 
right angle are different also; the carpenter restricts himself to what helps 
his work, but the geometer inquires into what, or what sort* of thing, the 
right angle is, since he studies the truth. We must do the same, then, in 
other areas too, [seeking the proper degree of exactness], so that digres­
sions do not overwhelm our main task.
§20 Nor should we make the same demand for an explanation in all 
cases. On the contrary, in some cases it is enough to prove rightly that 
[something is true, without also explaining why it is true]. This is so, for

Book I, Chapter 7 §20 ARISTOTLE
1098b instance, with principles, where the fact that [something is true] is the 
first thing, that is to say, the principle.*
§21 Some principles are studied by means of induction, some by 
means of perception, some by means of some sort of habituation, and oth- 
5 ers by other means.* §22 In each case we should try to find them out by 
means suited to their nature, and work hard to define them rightly. 
§23 For they carry great weight* for what follows; for the principle seems 
to be more than half the whole,* and makes evident the answer to many 
of our questions.
\8
[Defense of the Account of the Good]
We shbqld examine the principle, however, not only from theT^clusion 
10 and premies [of a deduction], but also from what is said atout it;* for all 
the facts hahnonize with a true accoimt, whereas the truth soon clashes 
with a false onev* /
§2 Goods are owided, then, into three types, spine called external, 
some goods of the sbul, others goods of the body.* We say that the goods 
15 of the soul are goods most fully, and more thap the others, and we take 
actions and activities of tl^ soul to be [goods] of the soul. And so our 
accoimt [of the good] is rignMo judge by tins belief anyhow—and it is an 
ancient belief, and accepted bj^philosophers.
§3 Our account is also correcbm saying that some sort of actions and 
activities are the end; for in that wa^he end turns out to be a good of the 
20 soul, not an external good. / \
§4 The belief that the happy/persc^ lives well and does well also 
agrees with our account, since y/e have vir'lpally said that the end is a sort 
of living well and doing well./
§5 Further, all the feahites that people look fdkin happiness appear to 
be true of the end des^ibed in our account.* §6, For to some people 
25 happiness seems to b^virtue; to others prudence; to others some sort of 
wisdom; to others ^ain it seems to be these, or one of these, involving 
pleasure or requirihg it to be added;* others add in external prosperity as 
well. §7 Some df these views are traditional, held by many, while others 
are held by a f^ men who are widely esteemed. It is reasonable for each 
group not to pe completely wrong, but to be correct on one point at least, 
or even on ^ost points.
30 §8 Fir^, our account agrees with those who say happiness is virtue [in
generaljWr some [particular] virtue; for activity in accord with virtue is 
proper to virtue. §9 Presumably, though, it matters quite a bit whether 
we sfippose that the best good consists in possessing or in using—that is 
to^ay, in a state or in an activity [that actualizes the state].* For someone
