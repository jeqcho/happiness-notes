## 1. Aristotle: What Is Eudaimonia?

**Term and basic idea**

- Greek term: *eudaimonia*  
- Often translated as “happiness,” but better as **flourishing** or **living well**.
- Crucial point: it is **not a feeling or mental state** (like pleasure, satisfaction, or mood).  
  It is an **overall condition of your life** going well in a distinctively human way.

**Key features of eudaimonia**

1. **Final end (ultimate goal)**
   - Every action aims at some good (health, money, honor, etc.).
   - Some goods are sought for the sake of something else (money → buy things).
   - **Eudaimonia is what we choose only for its own sake**, never merely as a means.
   - Therefore it is the **highest human good** (the *summum bonum*).

2. **Complete and self-sufficient**
   - “Complete”: nothing further is needed to make it better as a kind of life.
   - “Self-sufficient”: having it is enough to make a life **choiceworthy and lacking nothing essential** (while still including relationships, community, etc.).
   - We do not add other goods to “improve” it in kind; they are already included in a flourishing life.

3. **An activity, not a state**
   - Eudaimonia = a **way of living and acting** over a **complete life**, not a momentary condition.
   - You can have the capacity for virtue and still not be flourishing if you are inactive or live badly.

4. **Objective, not just subjective**
   - People often equate happiness with pleasure, honor, or wealth.
   - Aristotle argues that these can be:
     - Dependent on others (honor).
     - Merely instrumental (wealth).
     - “Animal-like” if taken as the whole of life (pleasure).
   - Eudaimonia is about **actually living in a way that fulfills your nature as a human being.**

## 2. Aristotle’s Argument: Eudaimonia Is Living in Accordance with Reason

This is often called the **“function argument”**.

### Step 1: Things have characteristic functions

- For Aristotle, many things have a **function** (an characteristic activity or role):
  - Eye: to see well  
  - Knife: to cut well  
  - Harpist: to play the harp well
- The **good** for each kind of thing = **performing its function excellently**:
  - A good knife cuts well.
  - A good harpist plays the harp well.

### Step 2: Humans also have a characteristic function

- Body parts have functions, so **it’s plausible that a human being as a whole has a function.**
- To find the human function, we must look for what is:
  - **Distinctively human** (not shared with plants and animals in the same way).
- Consider candidate “lives”:
  1. **Life of nutrition and growth** – shared with plants → not distinctively human.
  2. **Life of perception and sensation** – shared with animals → still not distinctively human.
  3. What remains: a **life involving reason**.
- Human beings are distinguished by our capacity to **reason**:
  - We **have reason** and can **act in light of it**.
  - Therefore, the **human function = activity of the soul in accordance with reason** (or at least not without reason).

### Step 3: The human good = performing this function well

- For any thing:
  - Function of X = characteristic activity.
  - Good of X = performing that function **well**, in accordance with the relevant **virtue (excellence)**.
- Apply to humans:
  - Human function: **rational activity of the soul.**
  - Doing this well requires **excellence (virtue)** of the rational part.
  - So the **human good** (eudaimonia) is:
    - **Activity of the soul in accordance with virtue (excellence), involving reason, over a complete life.**

### Step 4: Two aspects of “living in accordance with reason”

From the lecture outline:

1. **Excelling in the activity of reasoning**
   - Thinking clearly, judging well, understanding what truly matters.
   - Developing intellectual virtues (wisdom, understanding, good judgment).

2. **Performing the actions that reason recommends**
   - Actually **acting** on rational insight.
   - Living virtuously: making choices and forming habits that embody what reason says is best.

So:  
**Eudaimonia for a human being is living a whole life where your reasoning is excellent and your actions follow that good reasoning.**

## 3. Excellence (Virtue) as the Mean Between Deficiency and Excess

### Arete: excellence or virtue

- Greek term: *arete* = **excellence**, **virtue**, **being outstanding at fulfilling your function.**
- Human virtues are ways of **being excellent in rational activity and in desires/actions guided by reason.**

### The “doctrine of the mean”

- Many virtues are **means between two opposite vices**:
  - One vice of **deficiency** (too little).
  - One vice of **excess** (too much).
- Virtue is the **right balance**, not too much and not too little.

**Examples (classic ones to know):**

1. **Courage**
   - Deficiency: **cowardice** (too much fear, too little confidence).
   - Excess: **rashness/recklessness** (too little fear, too much confidence).
   - Virtue (courage): **fearing and facing dangers in the right way**, at the right time, for the right reasons.

2. **Temperance (moderation with pleasures, e.g., food, drink, sex)**
   - Deficiency: **insensibility** (too little enjoyment, refusal of appropriate pleasures).
   - Excess: **self-indulgence** (overindulgence, lack of self-control).
   - Virtue: **taking bodily pleasures in the right amount, at the right time, in the right way.**

3. **Generosity**
   - Deficiency: **stinginess/meanness** (too little giving, too attached to money).
   - Excess: **wastefulness** (giving or spending too much, without proper reason).
   - Virtue: **giving the right amounts of money or resources to the right people, for good reasons.**

### Important clarifications

- **Not the arithmetic middle**
  - It is not simply “halfway” between two extremes.
  - What counts as the **mean is relative to the person and the situation**:
    - The right amount of food is different for a child vs. an athlete.
    - The right fear in battle depends on actual danger, responsibilities, etc.

- **Requires good judgment**
  - Finding the mean is not mechanical.
  - It requires **practical wisdom**: the ability to see what is appropriate here and now.
  - This is why Aristotle says “you have to have good judgment” to hit the mean.

- **Applies primarily to character traits, not everything**
  - Many **moral virtues of character** fit the mean model.
  - Some things (e.g., injustice, adultery) are wrong **in any amount**; they don’t have a virtuous “mean” in the same way.
  - But the mean structure is a central idea: **virtue as balanced, reason-guided responsiveness**, avoiding both deficiency and excess.

## 4. The Importance of Practice in Developing Excellence (Virtue)

### Virtue is acquired, not innate

- We are **not born virtuous or vicious**.
- We are born with the **capacity** to develop virtues.
- Whether we become excellent (virtuous) or not depends on **habituation** (forming habits through repeated actions).

### How we develop virtue: practice, practice, practice

1. **By doing virtuous actions**
   - Just as you become a good lyre-player by **playing the lyre repeatedly**,  
     you become just, courageous, or temperate by **doing just, courageous, or temperate actions repeatedly**.
   - We **shape our character** by our actions.
   - Repeated actions create **stable dispositions** (character traits).

2. **Role of a good upbringing**
   - Children need **good training and guidance** so that:
     - They are **habituated** to take pleasure in good actions and feel pain at bad ones.
     - They learn to follow reason instead of mere feelings or impulses.
   - Without good early habits, it is much harder to become virtuous later.

3. **Emulate exemplars**
   - Look at **excellent people** (moral exemplars) and imitate them.
   - Observing how they **feel, think, and act** in specific situations helps you learn:
     - What the **virtuous mean** looks like in practice.
     - How a good person balances fear and confidence, giving and saving, etc.

4. **Practical vs. theoretical knowledge**
   - Knowing the theory of virtue is **not enough**.
   - Aristotle stresses that **the aim is action, not just knowledge**.
   - Someone who **knows** what virtue is but does not **act** accordingly does not benefit much from their knowledge (like someone who knows about health but lives unhealthily).
   - Virtue must become **habitual**, so that:
     - Right actions feel natural.
     - Emotions and desires align with what reason judges to be good.

### Why practice is central for eudaimonia

- Remember: **eudaimonia = activity of the soul in accordance with reason and virtue.**
- To live that way steadily over a whole life, you need:
  - **Stable virtues of character** (courage, temperance, justice…).
  - **Developed intellectual virtues** (good judgment, practical wisdom).
- These can only be developed by **ongoing practice**:
  - Repeated rational choices.
  - Constant adjustment toward the mean.
  - Learning from exemplars and experience.

So for Aristotle, **flourishing (eudaimonia)** is not a quick emotional achievement;  
it is the result of a **lifetime of practicing and strengthening rational, virtuous activity**.
