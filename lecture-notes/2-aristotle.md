# Aristotle on Happiness (Eudaimonia) and Virtue  
*Exam-focused notes*

---

## 1. What is Eudaimonia?

### 1.1 Basic Idea

- **Eudaimonia** is usually translated as *happiness* or *flourishing*.
- For Aristotle, it is:
  - The **highest human good** – the ultimate aim of all our actions.
  - **Complete** – chosen entirely for its own sake, never as a means to something else.
  - **Self-sufficient** – if you have it, your life is lacking in nothing important.

### 1.2 Not a Feeling or Passing Mood

- Eudaimonia is **not**:
  - A temporary feeling of pleasure,
  - A mood like joy or contentment.
- It is an **overall condition of living well** over a whole life – a life that is going as a human life *ought* to go.

### 1.3 Why Not Pleasure, Wealth, or Honor?

Aristotle considers popular views and rejects them as the **highest** good:

- **Pleasure**:
  - Resembles the life of “grazing animals.”
  - Can be base, bodily, and not uniquely human.
  - Can be had by a thoroughly bad person.
- **Wealth**:
  - Clearly a **means** to other things, not an end in itself.
  - Therefore cannot be the *ultimate* end.
- **Honor**:
  - Depends on **other people’s opinions**, not on your actual state.
  - People seek honor as a sign that they are already good; so **virtue** seems more fundamental than honor.

**Conclusion:**  
Eudaimonia is not any one of these things. It is a **life of excellent human activity** – a life in which your distinctively human capacities are fulfilled in the best way.

## 2. Why Eudaimonia for a Person is Living in Accordance with Reason

### 2.1 The Function Argument (Core of Aristotle’s Reasoning)

Aristotle’s key move:  
**The good for a thing = excellent performance of its characteristic function.**

1. **Every function-thing has a “good”:**
   - For a flute-player, good = playing the flute well.
   - For a doctor, good = healing well.
   - For an eye, good = seeing well.
   - In general: the **good** of X is **doing its proper function excellently**.

2. **Human beings must also have a characteristic function:**
   - Like the eye or the flute-player, a human is a kind of thing with a role or function.
   - The function of the human cannot just be:
     - **Life/nutrition/growth** – plants have that too.
     - **Perception/sensation** – animals share that as well.
   - So the distinctively human function must involve what is **special to humans**.

3. **What is distinctively human? Reason.**
   - Humans uniquely:
     - Have the capacity for **rational thought** (theoretical and practical),
     - Can **organize their lives by reasons** rather than by mere impulse.
   - Therefore the **human function** is:
     > *Activity of the soul that involves reason or requires reason.*

4. **The human good = performing the human function excellently:**
   - Just as the good harpist plays well, the **good human**:
     - Engages in **rational activity**,
     - Does so **in accordance with virtue (excellence)**.
   - So the **human good** (eudaimonia) is:
     > *Activity of the soul in accordance with the best and most complete virtue, over a complete life.*

### 2.2 Two Aspects of “Living in Accordance with Reason”

The lecture outline helpfully breaks this into two parts:

1. **Excelling in the activity of reasoning itself**
   - Using reason well:
     - Thinking clearly,
     - Judging well about what is true (theoretical reasoning),
     - Judging well about what to do (practical reasoning).
   - This includes intellectual excellences like:
     - **Wisdom**, **understanding**, **practical wisdom (phronesis)**.

2. **Performing the actions that reason recommends**
   - Not enough to think well; you must **act** on good reasons.
   - Your actions and feelings should be:
     - In the **right way**,
     - At the **right time**,
     - For the **right reasons**,
     - As **good reason** dictates.

**Result:**  
For a person, **eudaimonia = living a life of rational activity in accordance with virtue** – both:
- exercising reason excellently, and  
- shaping one’s whole pattern of actions according to sound reason.

This is the **greatest good** (the *summum bonum*) for a human being.

## 3. Excellence (Virtue) as the Mean Between Deficiency and Excess

### 3.1 What is Arete (Excellence/Virtue)?

- **Arete** means **excellence** or **virtue** – being good at being the kind of thing you are.
- For humans, virtues are:
  - **Stable character traits** (e.g., courage, generosity),
  - That dispose us to **feel and act** in the right way,
  - In line with **reason**.

### 3.2 The Doctrine of the Mean

- Moral virtue is a **mean between two vices**:
  - One of **excess**,
  - One of **deficiency**.
- This “mean” is:
  - **Relative to us** – depends on the situation and person,
  - **Not** a simple arithmetic middle (“exactly halfway”),
  - Determined by **good judgment** (practical wisdom).

#### Structure:

- For each virtue, we can identify:
  - A relevant **sphere** (e.g., danger, money, honor, pleasure, anger),
  - The **deficiency** (too little),
  - The **excess** (too much),
  - The **virtue** (right amount in the right way).

#### Examples (very important to be able to produce):

- **Courage** (sphere: fear and confidence about danger):
  - Deficiency: **cowardice** (too much fear, too little confidence),
  - Excess: **rashness** (too little fear, too much confidence),
  - Virtue: **courage** (fears the right things, at the right times, to the right degree, for good reasons).

- **Generosity** (sphere: giving and taking money):
  - Deficiency: **stinginess/meanness** (gives too little),
  - Excess: **wastefulness** (gives too much, carelessly),
  - Virtue: **generosity** (gives the right amounts, to the right people, in the right way).

- **Temperance** (sphere: bodily pleasures, especially food, drink, sex):
  - Deficiency: **insensibility** (too little responsiveness even to appropriate pleasures),
  - Excess: **self-indulgence** (too much pursuit of pleasure),
  - Virtue: **temperance** (moderate enjoyment under the guidance of reason).

### 3.3 Role of Reason in the Mean

- The virtuous person:
  - Hits the **mean as reason would determine it**,
  - Given the circumstances.
- That is why we need:
  - **Practical wisdom (phronesis)** to see where the mean lies,
  - Not just a formula like “always choose the middle option.”

**Connection to eudaimonia:**  
Since eudaimonia is activity in accordance with virtue, and virtue = rationally finding and hitting the mean, **living well is consistently choosing the reasonable mean in actions and feelings.**

## 4. The Importance of Practice in Developing Excellence (Virtue)

### 4.1 Virtue is Not Inborn or Merely Theoretical

- We are **not born** virtuous or vicious.
- We are born with the **capacity** to become virtuous.
- Moral virtue is **not**:
  - Simply a matter of knowing rules or theories,
  - Automatically produced by intellectual instruction alone.

Virtue is a **settled character state** formed by **habit**.

### 4.2 Habituation: How We Become Virtuous

Key idea:  
> We become just by doing just actions; we become brave by doing brave actions; we become temperate by doing temperate actions.

- **Habituation** = forming habits through **repeated actions**:
  - Repeatedly acting in the right way,
  - Under the guidance of reason (or of those who have it),
  - Gradually shapes our **character** and **emotional responses**.

Analogy used in the lecture outline:

- Like learning to play the **lyre (a musical instrument)**:
  - You don’t become a good musician by reading about music,
  - You must **practice, practice, practice** the right moves.
- Similarly:
  - You don’t become courageous merely by admiring courage,
  - You must **face fears in the right way** repeatedly.

### 4.3 Role of Upbringing and Exemplars

- **Good upbringing is crucial:**
  - Children must be trained to:
    - Take **pleasure** in good actions,
    - Feel **pain or shame** at bad actions.
  - This early training supplies the **starting points** from which ethical reasoning later develops.

- **Emulating exemplars:**
  - To know how the virtuous person acts, we:
    - Look at **wise and virtuous exemplars**,
    - Use their lives as models.
  - Imitating those who already have good character helps us:
    - Learn what the “mean” looks like in real situations,
    - Form similar habits ourselves.

### 4.4 Why Practice is Essential for Eudaimonia

- Eudaimonia = **excellent rational activity** over a life.
- But:
  - Without **practiced virtues**, our emotions and desires resist reason.
  - We may know what is right but **fail to do it**.
- Practice:
  - Aligns our **feelings, desires, and actions** with reason,
  - Makes acting virtuously **easier, more stable, and more pleasant**.

**Therefore:**  
To reach eudaimonia, it is not enough to ask, “What is my purpose?” or to see that it involves reason. You must **train yourself, through repeated practice and guided upbringing, to live in accordance with reason**, consistently hitting the mean that constitutes virtue.

### Quick Summary for Exam Recall

- **Eudaimonia**: objective flourishing; the highest human good; not mere feeling; complete and self-sufficient.
- **Why “in accordance with reason”?**
  - Human function = rational activity (distinctively human).
  - Human good = excellent performance of that function → activity of soul in accordance with virtue (rational excellence) over a complete life.
- **Virtue as mean**:
  - Virtue = excellence in character.
  - Each moral virtue is a mean between excess and deficiency, relative to us, found by right reason.
  - Examples: courage (between cowardice and rashness), generosity (between stinginess and wastefulness), temperance (between insensibility and self-indulgence).
- **Practice and habituation**:
  - We acquire virtues by **repeatedly performing virtuous actions**.
  - Good upbringing and role models are vital.
  - Practice aligns feelings and actions with reason, enabling a life of eudaimonia.
