# Aristotle on Happiness (Eudaimonia) and Virtue  
*Focused exam notes*

---

## 1. What Is Eudaimonia?

**Key term:**  
- **Eudaimonia** is usually translated as “happiness,” but better as **“flourishing”** or **“living well.”**

**Not a mere feeling or mood**  
- Not just pleasure, contentment, or a positive mental state.  
- It is about the **overall quality of a life**, not momentary experiences.  
- Someone might feel happy yet live a shallow, vicious, or wasted life – Aristotle would not call that eudaimonia.

**The highest human good**  
Eudaimonia is:

1. **Final (ultimate) end**  
   - We choose everything else (money, honor, pleasure, health, etc.) for the sake of something further.  
   - **Eudaimonia is never chosen for the sake of something else**; it is desired **for its own sake**.

2. **Complete (nothing further needed to improve it as an end)**  
   - If you could add another good (e.g., a bit more money) and that made it a better *end*, then the original wasn’t fully complete.  
   - Eudaimonia is already the **most complete** form of living well.

3. **Self-sufficient**  
   - Enough by itself to make life **worth living and lacking in nothing essential**.  
   - Includes not just the individual, but a life within human relationships (family, friends, community), since humans are social/political animals.

**Where is eudaimonia located?**  
- Goods can be:
  - **External** (wealth, status),
  - **Bodily** (health, strength),
  - **Of the soul** (virtues, activities of thinking and choosing).
- Aristotle says the **most important goods are of the soul**.  
- So eudaimonia is primarily **a way of living and acting** — **excellent activity of the soul**, not external possession or bodily condition.

**Summary:**  
Eudaimonia = **a complete, self-sufficient life of doing well**, chiefly consisting in **excellent rational activity**, not in mere pleasure, wealth, or honor.

## 2. Why Eudaimonia for Humans Is Living in Accordance with Reason

### (a) The Function Argument

Aristotle’s strategy:  
- To find the human good, ask: **What is the characteristic function (ergon) of a human being?**  
- For anything with a function, its **good** consists in **performing that function well**.

Examples:
- The good of a **flute-player** = playing the flute well.  
- The good of a **knife** = cutting well.  
- In general: **Good X = excellent performance of X’s distinctive function.**

Apply this to humans:

1. **Everything that has a function has a good tied to that function.**  
   - Eyes → seeing well.  
   - A harpist → playing well.

2. **Does a human as such have a function?**  
   - Not just whatever a particular person happens to do (e.g., “shoe-making”), but what **humans as a kind** are for.

3. **What activities do humans share with other beings?**  
   - **Nutrition and growth** → shared with plants.  
   - **Perception and basic desire** → shared with animals.  
   - These cannot be the *distinctively human* function.

4. **What is distinctively human?**  
   - The capacity for **reason**:
     - Using reason to **think, deliberate, and understand**.
     - Using reason to **guide actions and desires**.

5. **Conclusion about our function**  
   - The human function = **activity of the soul involving reason**:
     - Using reason itself.
     - Obeying or following reason in action.

### (b) From Function to Eudaimonia

Once we know the function, we ask: what is it to do it **well**?

1. **The function of a human being**:  
   - **Rational activity of the soul** (thinking and acting in line with reason).

2. **The function of a good human being**:  
   - Rational activity **performed well**, i.e., **in accordance with virtue (excellence)**.

3. **Therefore, the human good (eudaimonia):**  
   - **Activity of the soul in accordance with virtue**, especially the best and most complete virtue.  
   - **Over a complete life** (not just one good day or moment).

**Living in accordance with reason – two aspects (from the lectures):**

1. **Excelling in reasoning itself**  
   - Thinking clearly, judging well, understanding what is truly good.  
   - Having intellectual virtues (e.g., wisdom, practical judgment).

2. **Performing the actions reason recommends**  
   - Actually **acting** in line with good reasoning: acting justly, courageously, temperately, etc.  
   - So it is not enough to know what is right; one must **do it consistently**.

**Summarizing Aristotle’s argument:**

1. The highest good is the **final, complete, self-sufficient end** → eudaimonia.  
2. The human function is **rational activity of the soul**.  
3. Doing one’s function well = activity in accordance with **virtue**.  
4. So **eudaimonia for a human = a life of excellent rational activity, thinking and acting in accordance with reason and virtue**.

## 3. Excellence (Virtue) as the Mean Between Deficiency and Excess

**Key term:**  
- Greek: **arete** – usually translated as **virtue** or **excellence**.

### (a) Character virtue as a state

- Moral (character) virtues are **stable states of character** that dispose us to:
  - **Feel** appropriately,
  - **Choose** appropriately,
  - **Act** appropriately.

### (b) The doctrine of the mean

Aristotle’s central idea:  
- **Moral virtue is a mean between two vices**:
  - One of **excess**,
  - One of **deficiency**.

Formally:
- Virtue is a **mean “relative to us”**, determined by **reason** and by what the person of practical wisdom would decide.

**Important clarifications:**

1. **Not the simple arithmetic middle**  
   - The mean is not just splitting the difference numerically.  
   - It depends on the person and situation (e.g., the right amount of food differs by body type, activity level).

2. **Mean in terms of emotions and actions**  
   - Virtue = feeling and acting:
     - **At the right time**,  
     - **About the right things**,  
     - **Toward the right people**,  
     - **For the right reasons**,  
     - **In the right way**.

3. **The extremes are vices**  
   - Each virtue lies between **two bad extremes**.

### (c) Standard examples

1. **Courage**  
   - Concerns: **fear and confidence** in the face of danger.  
   - **Deficiency (too much fear, too little confidence):** cowardice.  
   - **Excess (too little fear, too much confidence):** rashness.  
   - **Mean:** courage – fearing the right things, in the right way, and standing firm when reason says one should.

2. **Temperance (moderation)**  
   - Concerns: **bodily pleasures** (especially food, drink, sex).  
   - **Deficiency:** insensibility (not enjoying what a human reasonably should).  
   - **Excess:** self-indulgence (overvaluing and overpursuing such pleasures).  
   - **Mean:** temperance – enjoying such pleasures in appropriate ways and amounts.

3. **Generosity (liberality)**  
   - Concerns: **giving and taking money**.  
   - **Deficiency:** stinginess/meanness.  
   - **Excess:** wastefulness/prodigality.  
   - **Mean:** generosity – giving the right amounts to the right people at the right times, in line with good judgment.

**Why the mean view matters for eudaimonia:**

- Since eudaimonia is **excellent rational activity**, and virtue = **the state that enables us to choose and act well**,  
- Cultivating the virtues (these means) is essential to **living in accordance with reason** and thus to **flourishing**.

## 4. The Importance of Practice in Developing Excellence (Virtue)

### (a) Virtue is acquired, not innate

- Aristotle thinks we are **not born virtuous or vicious**.  
- We are born with the **capacity** to develop virtues or vices.  
- Whether we become virtuous depends heavily on **habituation (practice)**.

### (b) Habituation: we become what we repeatedly do

Core idea:
- **We become just by doing just actions;**  
- **We become temperate by doing temperate actions;**  
- **We become courageous by doing courageous actions.**

Analogy from the lectures:
- Like learning to play the **lyre/instrument**:
  - You don’t become a good musician by merely **learning theory**.  
  - You become a good musician by **repeated practice of the right kind of playing**, under guidance.

Similarly for virtue:
- Knowledge alone is not enough.  
- One must **perform virtuous actions often enough** that they **shape one’s character**.

### (c) Role of upbringing and social environment

- **Good upbringing is crucial**:
  - Families and laws should **train us from youth** to take pleasure in good actions and feel pain at bad ones.  
  - This early training sets our character on a particular path.

- The right environment:
  - Being around people and institutions that **encourage and reward virtuous actions** makes it easier to habituate virtue.

### (d) Emulating exemplars

- One way to learn what the virtuous mean looks like in practice:
  - **Observe and imitate moral exemplars**, people of **practical wisdom and good character**.  
  - Ask: What would a truly brave, just, or generous person do here?

### (e) Why practice is necessary for eudaimonia

1. **Living in accordance with reason** requires **stable character**, not occasional good choices.  
2. Stable character only develops through **long-term habituation**.  
3. Without virtues, our feelings and desires will **pull us away** from what reason recommends.  
4. So **practice (habituation) is essential** if we are to:
   - Consistently act in accordance with reason,  
   - Possess the virtues,  
   - And thereby **achieve eudaimonia**.

### Very Short Exam-Style Summary

- **Eudaimonia**: The highest human good; a **complete, self-sufficient life of flourishing**, consisting in **excellent rational activity** rather than in mere pleasure, wealth, or honor.

- **Why eudaimonia = living according to reason**:  
  - Human **function** = rational activity (distinctive capacity).  
  - Good human life = **performing this function excellently**, i.e., **activity of the soul in accordance with virtue** over a complete life.

- **Virtue as mean**:  
  - Moral virtue is a **state of character** that aims at the **mean between excess and deficiency** (relative to us), as determined by reason.  
  - Examples: courage between rashness and cowardice; temperance between self-indulgence and insensibility; generosity between wastefulness and stinginess.

- **Practice in developing virtue**:  
  - Virtue is formed by **habituation**, like a skill.  
  - We become virtuous by **repeatedly doing virtuous actions**, guided by good upbringing and exemplars, until we possess stable character that allows us to **live consistently in accordance with reason** and thus to flourish.
