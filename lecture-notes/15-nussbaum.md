## 1. Central Human Capabilities

### 1.1 Central Question and Ideas of Tragedy & Dignity

- Guiding question of Nussbaum’s approach:  
  **“What is this person actually able to do and to be?”**
- Human dignity: a truly human life is one where a person can develop and exercise distinctively human powers (reason, sociability, emotion), not merely survive like a well-cared-for animal.
  - Example: well-fed zoo animals live in comfort but lack many human-like capabilities (freedom of movement, choice, rich social bonds). Their lives illustrate **loss of dignity**.
- **Tragedy**: When people lack the conditions to develop central capabilities, their lives are tragically stunted, even if they stay alive and feel “content.”
- Central idea: certain capabilities “exert a moral claim that they should be developed.” Blocking them is a violation of human dignity.

### 1.2 Examples of Central Human Capabilities (know at least three)

Nussbaum offers a list; these are **separate**, intrinsic components of a flourishing life. Know at least these four:

#### 1. Bodily Health
- Being able to have good physical health, including:
  - Adequate nutrition
  - Basic medical care
  - Reproductive health
  - Shelter
- Without this, a person may survive but in a damaged, undignified way (e.g., constant illness, malnutrition).

#### 2. Emotions
- Being able to:
  - Form attachments to people and things
  - Love and be loved
  - Grieve the loss of loved ones
  - Feel longing, gratitude, justified anger
- Nussbaum **disagrees with the Stoics**, who aimed to eliminate emotions like grief and fear.  
  She thinks:
  - Rich emotional life is essential to being fully human.
  - Eliminating these emotions would *impoverish* a life, not perfect it.

#### 3. Affiliation
- Being able to:
  - Live with and toward others
  - Recognize others as fellow human beings
  - Show concern, empathy, and compassion
  - Participate in friendships, family, and community
  - Be treated with respect, without humiliation or discrimination
- In work: being able to relate to others as equals, not as mere tools.

#### 4. Play
- Being able:
  - To laugh
  - To play
  - To enjoy recreational activities
- A life with no time or opportunity for play is missing an important dimension of human flourishing.

### 1.3 Criteria for Being a Central Human Capability

What makes something count as a **central** human capability, rather than just a preference?

Nussbaum’s key criteria:

1. **Essential for a “truly human” life, not merely an animal life**
   - These capabilities mark the difference between basic survival and a life worthy of human dignity.
   - If lacking them makes a life “more or less like an animal’s,” then they are candidates for central capabilities.

2. **Intrinsic value, not merely instrumental**
   - They are valuable in themselves, not only as means to other goals.
   - Example: Affiliation is not just useful for economic success; relationships and mutual recognition are part of a good life in their own right.

3. **Foundational for pursuing any life plan**
   - They are general preconditions for virtually any reasonable conception of the good life.
   - Example: Practical reasoning and basic health are needed to pursue *any* serious life project.

4. **Cross-cultural resonance, tied to tragedy and human dignity**
   - When these capabilities are missing, people across cultures typically recognize this as a **tragedy**.
   - Think of how stories of:
     - Enforced isolation
     - Humiliating treatment
     - Starvation
     - Political oppression  
     evoke a sense that something deeply human has been violated.

5. **Politically justifiable as minimal thresholds**
   - The list is designed for political purposes: to specify what a just society must secure **at least to a threshold level** for **each person**.
   - Not a full theory of the good life, but a *partial* one that many worldviews can endorse.

6. **Capabilities, not just resources or actual functionings**
   - Focus is on **real opportunities** (what one is able to do/be), not:
     - Just resources (e.g., money)
     - Or actual choices made.
   - Example: It matters that a woman has the genuine opportunity to work outside the home, even if she chooses not to.

7. **Moral evaluation of abilities**
   - Not every human capacity qualifies.
   - Only those judged **morally valuable** from an ethical point of view.
   - Example: Capacity for cruelty is a real human power but is **excluded** from the list.

8. **Each person as an end**
   - Capabilities must be secured for **every individual**, not just for the group “on average.”
   - You cannot justify sacrificing one person’s basic capabilities for the sake of overall social gain.

## 2. Incommensurability of Capabilities

### 2.1 What “Incommensurable” Means for Nussbaum

- The capabilities on Nussbaum’s list are **separate components** of a flourishing life.
- **Incommensurable**: you **cannot compensate** for severe lack of one capability by giving more of another.
  - No single scale of value on which all capabilities can be traded off against each other like money.

### 2.2 Key Claims

1. **No substitution across capabilities**
   - Missing one central capability is a serious loss that cannot be “made up” by excess in another.
   - Example:
     - High income cannot compensate for lack of political freedom.
     - Excellent health cannot compensate for forced social isolation or lack of emotional attachments.

2. **Each capability has its own distinctive value**
   - Each answers to a different dimension of what it is to be fully human:
     - Health, emotional life, social relations, play, etc.
   - Losing one is not like losing a quantity of the same good; it is losing a **different** type of good.

3. **Limits cost–benefit reasoning**
   - Simple cost–benefit analysis encourages trade-offs in one homogeneous “currency” (e.g., money, utility).
   - Nussbaum’s view:
     - Pushing people below the threshold in **any** central capability is a **tragedy**.
     - That tragic aspect is not captured by merely summing or averaging benefits in other areas.

4. **Two “architectonic” capabilities**
   - Practical reason and affiliation “organize and suffuse” the others:
     - Health, work, and play should be available in ways that allow reason and social interaction.
   - But even these do **not** reduce the other capabilities to mere means: the others still have their own irreducible worth.

## 3. Objection to Life Satisfaction Theories: Adaptive Preferences

### 3.1 Life Satisfaction Theories

- These theories define well-being, happiness, or quality of life in terms of:
  - How satisfied people say they are with their lives
  - Or how well their preferences are fulfilled.
- Policy consequence: If people **report** high satisfaction, they are deemed well-off.

### 3.2 Adaptive Preferences

- **Adaptive preferences**: people often adjust their desires and standards **downward** to fit what they realistically can get in oppressive or deprived conditions.
  - People learn not to want what they’re systematically prevented from having.
  - They may come to accept humiliation, lack of opportunities, or discrimination as “normal” or even “good.”

Examples:
- A woman in a patriarchal society:
  - Taught from childhood that obedience and self-sacrifice are virtues.
  - Comes to report being “satisfied” with a life with no education, no job, and no say in family decisions.
- The “zoo animal” thought:
  - Animals may be calm and content in captivity.
  - But we still think it tragic that they cannot roam, hunt, or live their natural lives.

### 3.3 Nussbaum’s Objection Using Adaptive Preferences

1. **Subjective satisfaction can mask objective deprivation**
   - People who are deeply deprived of central capabilities can **sincerely** claim to be satisfied, because they have **adapted** to their circumstances.
   - Life satisfaction measures would therefore **misclassify** many unjust situations as acceptable or even good.

2. **Loss of aspiration is itself part of the harm**
   - The process of adaptation—learning not to want basic freedoms, education, or respect—is itself a form of damage to human flourishing.
   - Life satisfaction theories take this damage as “evidence of well-being,” which is perverse.

3. **Better question: capabilities, not satisfaction**
   - Instead of asking “How satisfied is this person?” we should ask:
     - “What is this person actually able to do and to be?”
   - The capabilities approach:
     - Can recognize that a woman or poor person may be *subjectively content* yet **objectively deprived** of crucial opportunities.

Conclusion:  
Because of adaptive preferences, **life satisfaction is not a reliable measure** of human flourishing. We need a standard (like the capabilities list) that can criticize unjust, dignity-denying conditions even when people have adapted to them psychologically.

## 4. Objection to Hedonism: Good Pains and Bad Pleasures

### 4.1 Hedonistic Theories

- **Hedonism**: Well-being or happiness consists solely in:
  - The presence of pleasure
  - The absence of pain.
- All pleasures are treated as good (or at least good *for* the person), all pains as bad.

### 4.2 Nussbaum’s Core Claim

- Not all pleasures are good, and not all pains are bad.
- Emotional life is partly evaluated by its **fittingness** and **moral quality**, not just by how it feels.
- There are:
  - **Good pains**: painful experiences that are appropriate or integral to a flourishing human life.
  - **Bad pleasures**: pleasurable experiences that reflect or produce moral failure and damage to flourishing.

---

### 4.3 Good Pains: Grief and (some) Fear

#### A. Grief

- Grief over the loss of a loved one is:
  - Painful and distressing.
  - But an **appropriate** emotional response to something deeply valuable.
- It expresses:
  - Love
  - Recognition of the importance of the person lost
  - Depth of attachment and commitment.
- In Nussbaum’s framework:
  - Grief is part of the **Emotions capability** and the **Affiliation capability**.
  - A person who never grieves may be emotionally stunted or detached, lacking full human connection.
- So:
  - Grief is a **good pain**—it contributes to a richer, more fully human life, even though it hurts.

#### B. Fear

- Fear can be:
  - Overwhelming and damaging (e.g., chronic terror that “blights emotional development”).
  - Or **appropriate and valuable** when proportionate to real danger.
- Appropriate fear:
  - Protects **Life** and **Bodily Health** capabilities.
  - Shows realistic awareness of threats.
  - Motivates prudent action (e.g., leaving a dangerous situation).
- Thus:
  - Some fear is a **good pain**, necessary to a rational, realistic grasp of the world and self-preservation.
  - Total absence of fear would be reckless, not ideal.

### 4.4 Bad Pleasures: Pleasure in Harming Others

- Consider someone who takes intense pleasure in:
  - Cruelty
  - Humiliating others
  - Inflicting pain (a sadist).
- From a hedonistic perspective:
  - This person is “happier” because they experience more pleasure.
- Nussbaum’s view:
  - This is a **bad pleasure**.
  - It:
    - Violates the capability of **Affiliation** (failure to recognize others as equals with dignity).
    - Damages the agent’s character and emotional life.
    - Harms victims’ capabilities (bodily integrity, emotions, self-respect).
- Even if the sadist *feels* good, we do **not** judge that their life is going better in any deep sense.
- This shows:
  - Quality and moral content of pleasure matter.
  - We can and should say: some pleasures make a life **worse**, not better.

---

### 4.5 Summary: Why Hedonism Fails

1. **Hedonism can’t distinguish morally good from morally bad enjoyment**
   - Treats all pleasure as positive for well-being, regardless of its object.
   - Ignores the idea that pleasures can express cruelty, hatred, or contempt.

2. **Hedonism can’t account for the value of appropriate suffering**
   - Views all pain as something to be minimized.
   - Cannot explain why a life *without* grief or courageously borne fear would be **impoverished**, not ideal.

3. **Capabilities approach evaluates emotions by their role in a dignified life**
   - Emotions are central capabilities themselves.
   - They are assessed by:
     - Whether they fit the world appropriately
     - Whether they support or damage other central capabilities (affiliation, practical reason, etc.).
   - Thus:
     - **Good pains** (like grief and appropriate fear) are integral to flourishing.
     - **Bad pleasures** (like sadistic enjoyment) count against flourishing.

---

### 4.6 Link to Nussbaum vs. Stoics

- Stoics: ideal is freedom from disturbing emotions (apatheia); emotions like grief and fear are seen as errors.
- Nussbaum:
  - Emotions are key to **Emotions** and **Affiliation** capabilities.
  - They embody judgments about what is valuable.
  - Properly cultivated emotions (with their pains) are part of a flourishing life.
- So:
  - Both against Stoicism and against hedonism, Nussbaum defends the idea that **the right emotions—even when painful—are good for us**, and the wrong emotions—even when pleasant—are bad for us.
