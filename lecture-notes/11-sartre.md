## 1. Existence Precedes Essence

### Traditional view (essence precedes existence)
- For made objects (e.g., a paperknife):
  - The maker has a plan or concept (its **essence**) before it exists.
  - Its essence: what it is for, what it should be like, its proper function.
- In many religious / traditional philosophies:
  - God designs a **fixed human nature** and purpose.
  - Each person is an instance of this pre‑given “human essence.”
  - Morality, meaning, and life‑plans can be read off from this essence.

### Sartre’s existentialist view
- **“Existence precedes essence” for human beings.**
  - There is no God who has a plan or “blueprint” for humans.
  - Therefore, there is **no fixed human nature** that dictates what we should be.
  - A human being **first exists** (is “thrown into the world”) and only later, through their life, **becomes something**.
- For Sartre:
  - At the beginning, you are “nothing” in the sense of having no fixed essence.
  - Your **essence = what kind of person you are, what you value, the meaning of your life.**
  - This is not given in advance; it is **created over time**.

**Key exam point:**  
For humans, unlike tools or artefacts, there is no pre‑established essence. We **first exist**, encounter ourselves in the world, and **only then define ourselves** by what we do.

## 2. Freedom: “Condemned to Be Free”

### Determinism vs libertarianism (about free will)

**Determinism**
- Thesis: Every event (including every human choice and action) is **fully determined** by:
  - prior events + laws of nature.
- Given the total state of the world at time T and the laws of nature, **only one future is possible.**
- Implication for persons:
  - Your actions are ultimately the result of prior causes (genes, upbringing, environment, brain states).
  - You **could not have done otherwise** in the exact same situation.
  - Human beings are treated like complex **objects**, comparable to tables or chairs whose behavior is fully predictable from their physical constitution and circumstances.

**Libertarianism (about free will)**
- Thesis: Some human actions are **not determined** by prior causes and laws of nature.
- When you act freely:
  - You **genuinely could have done otherwise**, even if everything before that moment had been the same.
  - You are a **source** of your actions, not simply a “result” of past events.
- This is a **metaphysical** (philosophical) view about free will, not about politics.

### Sartre’s position
- Sartre is a **libertarian** about free will and **rejects determinism.**
  - Determinism, he says, “makes a person into an object” like a table or chair.
- **“Man is freedom.”** There is no fixed human nature and no external plan; thus:
  - There are **no given values or scripts** that dictate your choices.
  - Every time you act, you **choose**, and you could have chosen otherwise.
- **“Man is condemned to be free.”**
  - You did not choose to exist, or to be in this situation, but:
  - **Once you exist**, you **cannot avoid choosing**; even not choosing is a choice.
  - There is **no external authority or deterministic cause** you can legitimately appeal to as an excuse.
  - From the moment you are “thrown into the world,” you are **responsible for everything you do.**

### “No excuses” and responsibility
- Because determinism is false (on Sartre’s view), you cannot truly say:
  - “I couldn’t help it; it was my upbringing / my temperament / my passions / society / fate.”
- Sartre:
  - “There is no determinism — man is free, man is freedom.”
  - “The first effect of existentialism is that it places the entire responsibility for his existence squarely on his own shoulders.”
- You can **try** to hide behind excuses (passions, character, deterministic theories), but then you are in **self‑deception** (bad faith).

**Key exam point:**  
“Condemned to be free” means:  
1) you did not choose to exist,  
2) there is no external script or nature that determines you, and  
3) you are therefore **inescapably responsible** for your choices and who you become.

## 3. Essence Created Only by Actions

### What is “essence” for Sartre?
- Your **essence** = what kind of person you are:
  - your character (cowardly, courageous, generous, selfish, etc.),
  - your real values and priorities,
  - the meaning and purpose of your life.
- Traditional view: essence is **given** (by God, nature, biology, or a fixed human nature).
- Sartre’s view: essence is **made**, not given.

### “There is no reality except in action”
- According to Sartre, what creates your essence is **only your actions**, not:
  - your intentions,
  - your plans and promises,
  - your “potential” or talents,
  - your feelings or inner states,
  - your personality traits or temperament,
  - your self‑image or identity labels.
- He insists:
  - “Man is not what he conceives himself to be, but what he wills.”  
  - “There is no love apart from the deeds of love; no potentiality of love other than that which is manifested in loving.”

**Implication:**  
If something never shows up in your **actions**, it is not part of your real essence. At most, it is an *unrealized possibility*.

## 4. Coward vs Hero: Actions Define You

### How Sartre defines cowardice and heroism
- **Coward**:
  - A person who **performs cowardly actions** (e.g. repeatedly fleeing danger unfairly, betraying others out of fear, failing to take responsibilities one recognizes).
- **Hero**:
  - A person who **performs heroic actions** (e.g. courageously facing risk or sacrifice for worthy ends, persistently acting in the face of danger or difficulty).

**Central point:**  
There is **no such thing as a cowardly (or heroic) “nature”** that fixes you independently of action.

- You are **not** a coward because:
  - you have “cowardly genes,”
  - you have a fearful personality,
  - you feel scared,
  - you *imagine* yourself as weak.
- You **are** a coward if, when actual situations arise, you **choose cowardly conduct**.
- Likewise, you are a **hero** only if you **do heroic things**.

### Always free to change
- Because you are always free, Sartre says:
  - There is **always a possibility** for a coward to stop being cowardly by choosing courageous acts.
  - There is also a possibility for a hero to stop being heroic by ceasing those actions.
- Your past actions define **who you have been so far**, but:
  - Your **present and future choices** can **re‑create** your essence.
  - You are never permanently locked into “coward,” “hero,” or any other label.

**Key exam point:**  
On Sartre’s view, whether you are a coward or a hero is determined **solely** by what you in fact do, and this is up to you to change at any time by choosing different actions.

## 5. Commitment (e.g. to a Monogamous Marriage)

### What is commitment for Sartre?
- A **commitment** is not just:
  - an internal feeling,
  - a one‑time verbal promise,
  - a self‑image (“I’m a faithful spouse”).
- Rather, a commitment is:
  - a **pattern of actions over time** that expresses and sustains a chosen project or value.
  - your **ongoing choice** to structure your life in a particular way.

### Example: commitment to a monogamous marriage
- To be genuinely committed to a monogamous marriage, on Sartre’s view, means:
  - You **regularly act in ways** that honor that commitment:
    - you remain sexually faithful,
    - you say no to other romantic/sexual opportunities,
    - you invest time, care, and energy into your spouse and shared life,
    - you make long‑term decisions (where to live, financial choices, etc.) with the marriage as a central priority.
- If you say:
  - “I’m deeply committed to my marriage”  
  but:
  - repeatedly cheat, lie, or neglect your spouse,
- then, for Sartre, your **actions show** that you are **not** committed, whatever you may claim internally.

### Choosing for yourself and “for all humanity”
- Sartre also argues that when you choose for yourself, you implicitly:
  - **endorse a value**: you take what you choose to be **better** than the alternative.
  - You thereby **“legislate” for all humans** the value you express.
- Example: choosing monogamy
  - If you choose monogamous marriage for yourself (and actually act monogamously), you are:
    - implicitly affirming: “A life of faithful monogamy is better than its alternatives.”
    - thus, in Sartre’s terms, you are **committing not only yourself but also “humanity as a whole”** to the value of monogamy.
- This reinforces how **serious** commitment is:
  - you are not just picking a lifestyle; you are **creating and affirming values** through your actions.

**Key exam point:**  
Commitment = not what you *say* or *feel* you are committed to, but the **actions you consistently take** in support of a project (like monogamous marriage). Your commitment is only as real as your behavior.

## 6. Love (e.g. Love of Your Mother)

### Love as deeds, not just feelings
- Sartre: “There is no love apart from the deeds of love.”
- Love is not primarily:
  - a feeling in your heart,
  - a romantic ideal,
  - a private conviction (“deep down, I really care”).
- For Sartre:
  - Your **love** is what you **do**.
  - It is expressed and made real in **concrete actions**.

### Example: love of your mother
- To **love your mother** (on Sartre’s view) is to:
  - choose to **care** for her in actual situations:
    - visiting her,
    - listening to her,
    - helping her when she is sick or in need,
    - sacrificing time or opportunities to support her.
- In his famous example:
  - A student must choose between:
    - staying with his distressed mother, or
    - leaving to fight in the war.
  - Sartre’s key point: the **strength or reality** of his love for his mother **cannot be known independently of what he does**.
    - If he stays, he shows that love for her is decisive.
    - If he leaves, he shows that his commitment to the war effort takes precedence.
- Feelings or “inner love” that are **never acted on** do not count, for Sartre, as real love.

### Love, freedom, and responsibility
- Because you are always free:
  - You are **always responsible** for whether you act in loving ways.
  - You cannot say: “I truly love her, but circumstances made it impossible to act” as a full excuse.
- Love is thus a **freely chosen project**, sustained (or not) by your day‑to‑day actions.

**Key exam point:**  
On Sartre’s view, you love your mother (or anyone) **only insofar as you actually choose and act to care for them**. Love is defined by deeds, not by intentions or feelings alone.

## 7. Quick Summary for Revision

- **Existence precedes essence**:
  - No God, no fixed human nature.
  - Humans first exist, then create their nature/essence through what they do.
- **Libertarianism vs determinism**:
  - Determinism: every action fixed by prior causes + laws → no real alternatives.
  - Libertarianism: some actions are not determined; you genuinely could have done otherwise.
  - Sartre: rejects determinism, holds libertarian free will.
- **“Condemned to be free”**:
  - You did not choose to exist, but you cannot escape choosing.
  - No external authority or nature determines your choices.
  - You are fully responsible; excuses (fate, character, passions) are bad faith.
- **Essence created only by actions**:
  - What kind of person you are = the pattern of your actions.
  - Not your intentions, plans, potential, feelings, or self‑image.
- **Coward vs hero**:
  - Coward = one who performs cowardly actions.
  - Hero = one who performs heroic actions.
  - Always free to change by choosing different acts; labels are never final.
- **Commitment (e.g. monogamous marriage)**:
  - Commitment is made real only by a sustained pattern of actions.
  - To be committed to monogamy is to consistently act faithfully and shape your life accordingly.
  - Choosing such a life also expresses a value you implicitly hold up for all humans.
- **Love (e.g. of your mother)**:
  - “No love apart from the deeds of love.”
  - To love your mother is to actually care for her through concrete actions.
  - Feelings without action do not count as real love for Sartre.
