## 1. Bentham’s Hedonism: What Is Good?

**Core claim (hedonism about value)**  
- Pleasure is the only thing that is intrinsically good.  
- Pain is the only thing intrinsically bad.  
- Everything else (money, virtue, knowledge, friendship) is good only instrumentally, insofar as it produces pleasure or reduces pain.

**No qualitative differences between pleasures**  
- All pleasures are the same kind of thing: a pleasant feeling.  
- One pleasure is better than another only by being:
  - **More intense** (how strong the feeling is), and/or  
  - **Longer in duration** (how long it lasts).  
- So, in principle, an hour of playing video games and an hour of reading philosophy are equally good if the total intensity × duration of pleasure is the same.

*(Note: Bentham did list more “dimensions” in his calculus, but for exam purposes: only intensity and duration matter to the intrinsic value of a pleasure.)*


## 2. Bentham on What Motivates People (Psychological Hedonism)

**Psychological theory of human motivation**  
- Human beings are **always** motivated by the pursuit of their own pleasure and the avoidance of their own pain.  
- Every action can be explained, at bottom, by the agent’s expectation of:
  - Increasing their own pleasure, or  
  - Decreasing their own pain.  

**Implication**  
- Even seemingly altruistic acts (charity, self-sacrifice) are ultimately driven by the agent’s own expected pleasure (e.g., satisfaction, relief from guilt, approval from others) or avoidance of their own pain.


## 3. Bentham on How We Ought to Act (Utilitarianism)

**Principle of Utility (Greatest Happiness Principle)**  
- Morally right action: the action that produces the **greatest net balance of pleasure over pain** for **everyone affected**.  
- We must consider:
  - All people’s pleasures and pains **equally** (impartiality).  
  - The overall total, not just our own.

**So, morally:**  
- We ought to act so as to maximize **overall** happiness (total pleasure minus total pain), not just our own.  
- We should be willing, when required, to sacrifice our own pleasure if that increases the total amount of pleasure in the world.


## 4. The Tension in Bentham’s View: Motivation vs. Morality

**The tension**  
- **Descriptive claim (psychological hedonism):**  
  - People are always motivated only by their own pleasure/pain.  
- **Normative claim (utilitarianism):**  
  - People ought to act to maximize **everyone’s** pleasure, impartially.

**Why is this a problem?**  
1. **Ought implies can**  
   - If morality demands that we be motivated by the general happiness, but our psychology makes that impossible (we are motivated only by self-interest), then:
     - It seems we **cannot** do what morality requires.  
     - Moral requirements become unrealistic or incoherent.

2. **Self-interest vs. impartiality**  
   - Utilitarianism often requires:
     - Sacrificing your own significant pleasure for others’ smaller benefits.  
     - Taking on serious pain for the sake of strangers.  
   - But if our motives are always self-interested, why would we ever really do this?

**Bentham’s possible response (not fully resolving the tension)**  
- Use **laws, social pressure, and education** to align self-interest with the general happiness:  
  - Rewards and punishments make it in our **self-interest** to do what promotes overall happiness.  
- Still, the deeper worry remains:  
  - Morality seems to demand genuine concern for everyone’s happiness, while Bentham’s psychology allows only self-concern.


## 5. Mill’s Disagreement with Bentham: Higher vs. Lower Pleasures

**Mill accepts Bentham’s basic hedonism, but modifies it**  
- Mill agrees:  
  - Pleasure is the only intrinsic good.  
  - Pain is the only intrinsic bad.  
- Disagrees with Bentham about **relevant differences between pleasures**.

**Mill’s key claim: qualitative differences matter**  
- Some pleasures are not just different in **quantity** (intensity/duration) but in **quality**.  
- **Higher pleasures**:
  - Use our **distinctively human capacities** (reason, imagination, moral sentiment, aesthetic appreciation).  
  - Examples:  
    - Reading literature, doing philosophy, creating or appreciating art and music, deep friendship, moral reflection.  
- **Lower pleasures**:
  - More **bodily or sensory** pleasures, which we share with animals.  
  - Examples:  
    - Eating, drinking, sex, physical comfort, simple games.

**Mill’s slogan**  
- It is “better to be a human being dissatisfied than a pig satisfied; better to be Socrates dissatisfied than a fool satisfied.”  
- Indicates that the **kind** of pleasure matters, not just how much.


## 6. Mill’s Argument that Higher Pleasures Are More Valuable

### 6.1 Structure of Mill’s Argument (Competent Judges Test)

1. **Only those who have experienced both kinds can judge**  
   - To say whether pleasure A is better than pleasure B, you must have:  
     - Competent acquaintance with **both** A and B.

2. **Competent judges have a stable, strong preference**  
   - Among those who:
     - Have experienced both higher and lower pleasures, and  
     - Are capable of appreciating both,  
   - If nearly all of them:
     - Strongly prefer one kind of pleasure, and  
     - Would not give it up for any amount of the other,  
   - Then that preferred pleasure is of **higher quality** and **more valuable**.

3. **Empirical claim: competent judges strongly prefer higher pleasures**  
   - People who know both:
     - Intellectual, aesthetic, and moral pleasures, and  
     - Bodily and simple amusements,  
   - Tend to prefer the higher pleasures, even if:
     - They bring **more dissatisfaction**, or  
     - Require more effort or risk of pain.

4. **Conclusion**  
   - Therefore, **higher pleasures are more valuable** than lower pleasures,  
   - **Even holding intensity and duration fixed**, because:
     - Competent judges would choose a smaller amount of a higher pleasure over a larger amount of a lower one.  
   - So **quality** of pleasure matters, not just quantity.

### 6.2 How this fits Mill’s hedonism

- Mill still says **pleasure alone** is the good, but he thinks:  
  - The total value of a pleasure = a function of **both**:
    - Quantity (intensity × duration), **and**  
    - Quality (its “higher” vs. “lower” status as revealed by competent judges’ preferences).


## 7. Objections to Mill’s Argument for Higher Pleasures

You only need **one** clear objection for the exam; here are two standard ones.

### Objection 1: The “Non-Hedonic Values” Objection

**Idea**  
- Mill claims the greater value of higher pleasures is still a matter of **pleasure**.  
- But the competent judges’ preferences may be driven by factors **other than** pleasure:

  - They may value:
    - **Dignity**,  
    - **Moral worth**,  
    - **Rational agency**,  
    - **Meaning** or **nobility** of life.

- So when they say they would rather be “Socrates dissatisfied than a fool satisfied,” this might show:
  - They care about dignity or rationality **in addition to** pleasure, not that the higher life is more pleasant.

**Why this is a problem for Mill**  
- If higher activities are better partly because of dignity, rationality, or meaning **independent of how pleasant they feel**, then:
  - Mill is no longer a pure **hedonist** about value.  
  - He has smuggled in **non-hedonic values** (dignity, rational agency) as intrinsically good.
- This undermines his claim that **only** pleasure is intrinsically good.

### Objection 2: The “Circularity of Competent Judges” Objection

**Idea**  
- Mill’s test seems circular:

  1. He defines **higher pleasures** as those that competent judges prefer.  
  2. He defines **competent judges** as those who:
     - Have experienced both kinds of pleasure, and  
     - Prefer the higher, more “refined” pleasures.

- Then, when he argues:
  - “Higher pleasures are more valuable because competent judges prefer them,”  
  - It can seem like he is saying:  
    - “These pleasures are better because the people who think they’re better think they’re better.”

**Why this is a problem**  
- The argument risks lacking an **independent, non-question-begging** reason to treat higher pleasures as more valuable.  
- It may just restate the preference of a certain group instead of giving a deeper justification.
