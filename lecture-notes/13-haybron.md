## Sartre’s Existentialism – Exam Notes

---

### 1. “Existence Precedes Essence”

**Key ideas**

- For **artifacts** (e.g., knives, chairs):
  - Essence precedes existence: the designer has a plan/definition (its *essence*) before the thing exists.
  - Essence = what it is for, what it is supposed to be and do.

- For **human beings** (on Sartre’s view, given God does not exist):
  - There is **no** divine plan, fixed human “nature,” or built‑in purpose.
  - We **first exist** — find ourselves thrown into the world — and **only later** define who we are.
  - So: **“Existence precedes essence.”**

**What “essence” means here**

- A person’s “essence” = their **self‑definition or character**:
  - what kind of person they are (coward, hero, loyal, selfish, loving, etc.)
  - what values they actually live by.

**Consequences**

- There is **no given role or destiny** that determines what you must be.
- You **make yourself** by how you live.
- Any talk of “that’s just who I really am inside” is suspect unless backed by consistent actions.

### 2. Determinism vs Libertarianism (Freedom)

You must understand these general theories of free will to grasp “condemned to be free.”

#### Determinism

- **Determinism**: Every event (including every human choice) is **fully caused** by prior states of the world plus the laws of nature.
- If determinism is true:
  - Given the past and the laws of physics, **only one future is possible**.
  - Your “choices” are ultimately the inevitable outcome of factors beyond your control.

#### Libertarianism (about free will)

- **Libertarianism** (metaphysical, *not* political):
  - Some human choices are **not determined** by prior causes.
  - At the moment of choice, **you could genuinely have done otherwise**, even with the entire past and laws of nature fixed.
  - Free will requires **this sort of deep, undetermined freedom**.

#### Sartre’s Position

- Sartre is a **libertarian** about free will:
  - Our choices are not fixed in advance by nature, character, or circumstances.
  - Radical, inescapable freedom is a **basic fact of our situation**.

### 3. “Man is Condemned to be Free”

**Meaning of the phrase**

- “Condemned”:
  - We did **not choose** to exist.
  - Yet, once we exist, we **cannot escape** having to choose.
- “Free”:
  - We always have genuine alternatives; nothing **fully determines** our choices.
  - Even not choosing is itself a choice.

**Why it feels like a “condemnation”**

- There is **no external authority (God, nature, tradition)** that can tell us what we must do in a way that removes our responsibility.
- We are **wholly responsible**:
  - For our actions.
  - For what we become (our essence).
  - For the values we live by.
- This responsibility brings **anguish**:
  - We cannot hide behind “That’s just how I was made,” or “That’s my nature,” or “I had no choice.”

**Determinism vs Sartre’s picture**

- Against determinism: Sartre insists that **we** ultimately decide.
- We often *feel* determined (“I couldn’t help it”), but Sartre says this is usually **self‑deception** to avoid facing our freedom.

### 4. Essence is Created Only by Actions

**Central claim**

- A person’s essence (who they are) is created **only through their actions**, not by:
  - intentions,
  - personality traits,
  - potential,
  - feelings,
  - social labels.

**Coward vs Hero Example**

- **Cowardice/heroism** are not:
  - built‑in traits,
  - fixed psychological types,
  - predictions others make about you.

- On Sartre’s view:
  - You are a **coward** if you in fact keep acting in cowardly ways (running away, abandoning others, refusing to face danger when it matters).
  - You are a **hero** if you in fact act courageously (facing danger to help others, persisting under threat).

- Your:
  - self‑image (“I know deep down I’m brave”),
  - intentions (“I really meant to be brave”),
  - “potential” (“I could have been heroic”)
  
  do **not** determine what you are. **Only what you actually do does.**

**Freedom to change essence at any time**

- Since there is no fixed, essential “inner nature,” you are **always free** to act differently right now.
- Therefore:
  - A person who has been a coward **can become** a hero by actually acting bravely in future choices.
  - A person with a history of heroic deeds can **turn into** a coward by later refusing courage.
- There is **no point at which your character is permanently fixed**:
  - You are continually **re‑creating** yourself through present actions.

**Exam angle**

- If asked “On Sartre’s view, what makes someone a coward/hero?”:
  - Answer: **their pattern of actual deeds**, not their inner feelings or potential.
  - Stress the **possibility of change** at any time through new actions.

### 5. Commitment (e.g., to a Monogamous Marriage)

Sartre’s notion of commitment follows from radical freedom and “existence precedes essence.”

**What commitment is *not*** (for Sartre)

- Not a **once‑and‑for‑all inner decision** that magically fixes your future behavior.
- Not a **deep feeling** alone (“I feel very committed”).
- Not a **status or label** (“I’m married, so I’m committed by definition”).

**What commitment *is*** (in Sartrean terms)

- A **project** you **continually enact** through your choices.
- To be committed is:
  - to **keep choosing** in line with a certain pattern and value.
  - to keep acting in ways that **realize** that project in the world.

#### Commitment to a Monogamous Marriage

- To be committed to monogamy is:
  - To **repeatedly choose** fidelity:
    - not to cheat,
    - to invest time, care, and energy into this one partner,
    - to prioritize this relationship in concrete actions.
- You show your commitment:
  - by how you actually live: how you treat your spouse, the choices you make about sex, time, honesty, and shared life.
- Because you are always free:
  - the commitment is **never guaranteed or automatic**.
  - Every day you are **free to break it** — and thus free, if you don’t, to **re‑affirm it**.

**Tension with bad faith**

- A common form of **bad faith**:
  - Treating “I am a committed husband/wife” as a **fixed thing**, as if your role guarantees your behavior.
  - Using the role to **deny** your ongoing freedom and responsibility (“I’m married, *therefore* I will be faithful, end of story”).
- Sartre: Authentic commitment requires recognizing:
  - “I am the one who must **keep choosing** fidelity; nothing external forces me.”

**Exam angle**

- If asked “What is commitment on Sartre’s view?”:
  - Emphasize: **ongoing action**, not single promise or inner feeling.
  - Use monogamy example: you are committed only **insofar as** you act faithfully and keep choosing the marriage.

### 6. Love (e.g., Love of Your Mother)

Sartre’s general strategy is the same: focus on **acts and projects**, not mere inner states.

**What love is not (for Sartre)**

- Not just a **feeling of affection** or warmth.
- Not purely an **inner, private state** you can have regardless of what you do.
- Not guaranteed by **biological relation** (you don’t love your mother just because she is your mother).

**What love is (in Sartrean terms)**

- A **project** expressed in an ongoing pattern of behavior:
  - a way of **taking up the other person** in your life.
- To love someone (e.g., your mother) is:
  - to **act in ways** that express care and value for her:
    - helping her when she’s ill,
    - making time to see or call her,
    - listening, supporting, respecting her as a person,
    - organizing parts of your life around her well‑being.

**Feelings vs actions**

- You might *feel* strong affection but:
  - if you **never act** on it (never visit, call, help, or even think of her in your concrete decisions),
  - Sartre would say this “love” is **empty talk**, or at least **not your real project**.
- Conversely, someone without intense sentimental feelings but who **consistently cares and sacrifices** might count as truly loving, because their **actions** embody the project.

**Freedom and instability of love**

- Since you are always free:
  - You are not **bound** by your past declarations of love.
  - At any moment, you can **choose to stop loving** by changing how you act.
  - Authentic love is therefore something you must **keep re‑creating** through your choices.

**Love and bad faith**

- Bad faith in love:
  - Saying “I love my mother/partner; that’s just how it is,” while ignoring how your actions contradict this.
  - Hiding behind the word “love” to avoid facing the fact that you are not actually living that love.

**Exam angle**

- If asked “On Sartre’s view, what constitutes loving your mother?”:
  - Answer: A **pattern of concrete actions** that express care and value for her.
  - Stress: Feelings or intentions alone are **insufficient**; love is an ongoing **project** you **enact**.

### 7. Bad Faith vs Authenticity (Useful to Tie Everything Together)

Not a separate exam topic, but helps unify Sartre’s views above.

#### Bad Faith

- **Bad faith**: self‑deception about your own freedom and responsibility.
- Examples:
  - “I can’t help being a coward; that’s just my nature.”
  - “I had no choice but to cheat; my desires were irresistible.”
  - “I truly love my mother” while consistently neglecting or mistreating her.
- In each case, you **pretend you are determined** or that inner feelings alone define you, to **avoid blame** for your actions.

#### Authenticity

- **Authenticity**:
  - Acknowledging that you **are what you do**.
  - Owning your freedom and responsibility:
    - “If I am a coward, it is because I have acted cowardly.”
    - “If I want to be faithful/loving, I must actually **live that** in my choices.”

**Connection to all exam points**

- **Existence precedes essence** → no fixed nature; you define yourself.
- **Condemned to be free** → you cannot escape the task of choosing.
- **Essence created by actions** → coward, hero, lover, faithful spouse = patterns of deeds.
- **Commitment & love** → real only as **ongoing projects** enacted in what you do, not as inner labels.

Using this structure in an exam answer will show that you understand how all of Sartre’s claims hang together.
