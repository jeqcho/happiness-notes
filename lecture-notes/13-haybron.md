## 1. Haybron’s Basic Idea: Happiness as “Psychic Affirmation”

- **Happiness (for Haybron)** = a person’s *overall emotional condition* is broadly positive.
- More specifically: happiness is **psychic (emotional) affirmation** of one’s life:
  - To *emotionally* respond to your life **as if things are going well for you**.
  - It is about **moods and emotions**, not about explicit judgments or beliefs.

Contrast:

- **Cognitive affirmation**: judging or thinking “my life is going well.”
- **Emotional (psychic) affirmation**: feeling settled, secure, fulfilled, joyful, engaged, etc.

Haybron’s project: analyze this emotional condition into **three main dimensions**.

## 2. The Three Dimensions of Happiness

Haybron says happiness has (at least) **three dimensions**:

1. **Endorsement**
2. **Engagement**
3. **Attunement**

Each is a different *emotional way of responding* to one’s life.

### 2.1 Endorsement

**Basic idea:** emotional *approval* of your life; “thumbs up” feelings.

- Characteristic affects:
  - **Joy vs sadness**
  - **Cheerfulness vs irritability**
- When endorsement is high:
  - You often feel **happy, cheerful, delighted, joyful** about your life.
- When endorsement is low:
  - You feel **sad, dejected, gloomy, frequently irritated** with life.

**Example (high endorsement):**

- Someone who frequently feels **joy** when thinking about their relationships and work, laughs easily, and generally “feels good” about how life is going.

**Example (low endorsement, but other dimensions OK):**

- A professor deeply absorbed in meaningful work (high engagement) and at peace with life (high attunement) but going through a short period of **mild sadness** about a recent disappointment.

---

### 2.2 Engagement

**Basic idea:** being **energetically involved** in your life and activities.

Two key forms:

1. **Vitality / Exuberance vs Lethargy**
   - Feeling **energetic, alive, spirited** vs **sluggish, listless**.
2. **Flow vs Boredom**
   - **Flow**: being *fully absorbed* in challenging, meaningful activities; lose track of time and self-consciousness.
   - Opposite: **boredom/enui** – feeling empty, disengaged, going through the motions.

**Examples:**

- **High engagement:**
  - An athlete, artist, or doctor who often gets into **flow** while training, creating, or treating patients; feels **vital and absorbed**.
- **Low engagement:**
  - An office worker constantly **bored** and **listless**, watching the clock, feeling that nothing is worth investing energy in.

---

### 2.3 Attunement

**Basic idea:** being **at home in your life**; inner **settledness and security**.

Haybron breaks attunement into three main components:

1. **Peace of mind vs anxiety**
   - Calm, inner peace vs pervasive worry, nervousness, stress.
2. **Confidence vs insecurity**
   - Deep emotional **surety** and **inner stability** vs feeling shaky, unsure, emotionally off-balance.
3. **Uncompression vs compression**
   - Feeling **spiritually expansive, free, open** vs **cramped, pressured, small-souled** (see section on compression below).

**High attunement:**

- You feel:
  - Psychically **at home** in your life
  - **Relaxed, secure, unthreatened**
  - Free to be yourself; defenses are down; you’re not living in a state of constant vigilance.

**Low attunement (disattunement):**

- You feel:
  - **Anxious, stressed, on edge**
  - Alienated from your circumstances, as if you don’t really fit or belong
  - Under threat or constant pressure.

**Example (high attunement):**

- Someone with a modest job and modest income, but:
  - Has a stable community and routine;
  - Sleeps peacefully;
  - Rarely feels stressed;
  - Feels deeply **at home** in their environment and relationships.

**Example (low attunement, but maybe high endorsement):**

- A person in a high-paying job who often feels **cheerful** when things go well (some endorsement), but is:
  - Almost always **stressed**, worried about deadlines, reputation, and performance;
  - Emotionally “on guard.”
  - Haybron would say: despite some positive feelings, this person is **not really happy**, because attunement is badly damaged.

---

## 3. Which Dimension Is Most Important for Happiness, and Why?

According to Haybron, **attunement is the most important dimension**.

**Reasons:**

1. **Biological priority:**
   - For any creature, first priority is **safety and security**: being able to let down defenses.
   - Only once that’s in place does it make sense to:
     - Pursue projects energetically (**engagement**),
     - Or rejoice about successes (**endorsement**).

2. **Dependence of other dimensions:**
   - **Serious anxiety, stress, or insecurity** make it very hard to:
     - Enter **flow** or feel **vital**, and
     - Experience deep **joy or fulfillment**.
   - So **attunement is a precondition** for rich engagement and endorsement.

3. **Judgment about real-life cases:**
   - A **cheerful, energetic but deeply anxious** person still does **not** seem genuinely happy.
   - But a person who is **calm, confident, uncompressed**, even without constant cheerfulness, plausibly *is* happy.

**Exam tip:** If forced to choose, Haybron ranks:
- 1st: **Attunement**
- 2nd: **Engagement**
- 3rd: **Endorsement**

## 4. Compression and Its Place in the Three Dimensions

### 4.1 What Is Compression?

**Compression** = a pattern of **affective or “spiritual” shrinking**:

- Feeling:
  - **Pressed upon**, **crowded**, **trapped**
  - Emotionally **flattened**, **deflated**, **small**, like a “caged animal” or “worker ant”
- Living in a **reactive** mode:
  - Constantly responding to external demands;
  - Not living from your own nature or priorities.

Haybron’s label:
- **Uncompression**: feeling **expansive, free, large-spirited**.
- **Compression**: feeling **pinched, constrained, small-souled**.

### 4.2 Sources of Compression

Two main sources:

1. **Imposition / repression**
   - Life is largely **dictated by external forces**:
     - Heavy social pressure to conform;
     - Over-scheduling and impossibly long to-do lists;
     - Work or survival demands that leave little room for self-expression.

2. **Threat**
   - Persistent sense of being **under threat or scrutiny**:
     - Fear of failure;
     - Hostile or unstable environment;
     - Need to stay constantly cautious and on guard.

In both cases:
- You can’t act **naturally or freely**;
- You “hunker down” emotionally.

### 4.3 How Compression Fits into the Three Dimensions

Compression belongs **primarily to attunement**, but also affects engagement:

- **Attunement:**
  - Compression = a kind of **disattunement**:
    - You are *not* at home in your life.
    - Your emotional “stance” is defensive and reactive, not relaxed and confident.

- **Engagement:**
  - Compression tends to **kill exuberance** and reduce flow:
    - It’s hard to feel **vital, playful, or deeply absorbed** when you’re constantly pressured and on edge.

So:

- **Attunement component**: uncompression vs compression.
- **Engagement component**: compressed people are often **listless** or just pushing themselves mechanically, not genuinely engaged.

### 4.4 FOMO (Fear of Missing Out) and Compression

**FOMO** leads people to:

- Try to **do as much as possible**:
  - Say “yes” to every opportunity, social event, and activity.
  - Fill every spare moment.

This encourages:

- **Quantity over quality**:
  - Aim: *maximizing the number* of experiences,
  - Instead of *getting the most depth* out of a smaller number of meaningful activities.

Result:

- Life becomes **overcrowded** and **externally driven**.
- You end up:
  - **Stressed**, rushed, and **compressed**;
  - Rarely having the time or psychic space to relax into attunement or deep engagement.

### 4.5 “Junk” Activities

In this context, **“junk activities”** are:

- Activities you do mainly to **fill time**, avoid FOMO, or keep up appearances:
  - Endless social media scrolling
  - Parties you don’t enjoy but attend for status
  - Mindless errands and busywork
- They may bring **small, fleeting pleasures**, but:
  - Contribute little to **deep emotional well-being**.
  - Crowd out time for activities that foster:
    - **Attunement** (calm, confidence, uncompression)
    - **Engagement** (flow, meaningful projects)
    - **Endorsement** (genuine joy and fulfillment).

### 4.6 Central vs Peripheral Affective States

Haybron distinguishes:

- **Central affective states**:
  - Deep, pervasive moods/emotions that **shape your overall emotional condition**.
  - Examples:
    - Chronic anxiety or peace of mind (attunement),
    - Long-term vitality or lethargy (engagement),
    - Deep fulfillment or entrenched sadness (endorsement).

- **Peripheral affective states**:
  - Brief, superficial feelings that **do not significantly affect** how happy you really are.
  - Examples:
    - A quick laugh at a meme;
    - Enjoying a tasty snack;
    - Annoyance in traffic that quickly passes.

**Compression mainly damages central states:**

- It shapes your **baseline mood**:
  - Ongoing stress, feeling small, constrained, reactive.
- “Junk activities” mostly add **peripheral pleasures**:
  - They may feel nice short-term, but do **little** for your central emotional condition.

**Exam-useful summary:** A compressed, stressed life:
- Raises **peripheral** pleasures (lots of small hits),
- But undermines **central** happiness (especially attunement, and often engagement).

---

## 5. Are the Three Dimensions Incommensurable?

**Incommensurable** = not easily measurable on a single scale; not simply tradeable against each other.

Haybron’s view (roughly):

- The three dimensions represent **different ways** of emotionally responding to life.
- They are **not reducible** to a single “more or less happy” feeling.
- You can:
  - Be high in one dimension and low in another (e.g., energetic but anxious).
  - Have various **ideals** emphasizing different dimensions:
    - Stoic ideal: **attunement** (tranquility, peace).
    - Aristotelian/“flow” ideal: **engagement**.
    - Democritean/cheerfulness ideal: **endorsement**.

So:

- The dimensions are **partly incommensurable**:
  - You *cannot* always say “3 units of endorsement = 3 units of attunement.”
  - There are **different legitimate patterns** of happiness.
- But they also **interact**:
  - Strong disattunement undermines the other two.
  - Very high engagement can sometimes coexist with moderate attunement, etc.

## 6. Cognitive vs Emotional (Psychic) Affirmation

### 6.1 Definitions

**Cognitive affirmation:**

- To **respond cognitively** (with beliefs/judgments) to your life *as if it is going well*.
- Involves:
  - Reflective thoughts like: “Overall, my life is going well,” “I approve of my life.”
- Roughly corresponds to:
  - **Life satisfaction judgments** in psychology (“How satisfied are you with your life as a whole?”).

**Emotional (psychic) affirmation:**

- To **respond emotionally** (in moods/emotions) to your life *as if it is going well*.
- Involves having:
  - Positive patterns of **attunement, engagement, and endorsement**:
    - Peace of mind, confidence, uncompression (attunement),
    - Vitality, flow (engagement),
    - Joy, cheerfulness, fulfillment (endorsement).

**Haybron’s thesis:**

- **Happiness = emotional / psychic affirmation**, not cognitive affirmation.
- You can sincerely judge life is going well but still be unhappy if your **emotional condition** is poor.

### 6.2 Do Cognitive and Emotional Affirmation Go Together?

**They can go together, but they can also come apart.**

Haybron emphasizes that:

- **They often diverge**:
  - People are **bad at self-assessing** their own emotional condition.
  - Social pressures encourage us to **say** we’re satisfied even when emotionally troubled.
- Therefore:
  - **Cognitive affirmation ≠ Happiness**.

### 6.3 Examples of “Together” and “Come Apart”

Think of four basic combinations:

1. **Both cognitive and emotional affirmation high**  
   (Judgment and feelings say: “Things are going well.”)
   - Example:
     - A person who:
       - Reflectively believes they have a good life (supportive relationships, meaningful work),
       - Feels **calm, confident, often in flow, and experiences genuine joy**.
     - This is **paradigmatic happiness** for Haybron.

2. **High cognitive, low emotional affirmation**  
   (“Life is going well” in thought, but emotionally unhappy.)
   - Example:
     - A successful lawyer who thinks:
       - “I’ve achieved everything: money, status, family stability. I should be happy.”
     - But:
       - Is **chronically anxious and stressed** (low attunement),
       - Rarely feels engaged or in flow at work (low engagement),
       - Experiences little joy or fulfillment (low endorsement).
     - They have **cognitive affirmation without happiness**.
   - This is particularly important for Haybron: it shows **why life satisfaction ≠ happiness**.

3. **Low cognitive, high emotional affirmation**  
   (“My life is not going well” in thought, but emotionally quite happy.)
   - Example:
     - A graduate student who thinks:
       - “I’m a failure; others are more accomplished. My life is a mess.”
     - Yet actually:
       - Has strong friendships, is often in **flow** doing research/teaching,
       - Feels **relaxed, confident, and often joyful**.
     - They are, **emotionally**, pretty happy, even if **cognitively** they misjudge their life.

4. **Both cognitive and emotional affirmation low**  
   (Judgment and feelings agree: “Things are not going well.”)
   - Example:
     - Someone with severe work problems and family conflict, who:
       - Judges their life is bad,
       - Feels **anxious, depressed, disengaged, and joyless**.
     - Clearly **unhappy** by Haybron’s standard.

**Key exam point:**

- **Haybron’s position**:
  - Happiness **just is** emotional (psychic) affirmation of one’s life.
  - **Cognitive affirmation is neither necessary nor sufficient** for happiness:
    - Not necessary: you can be emotionally happy while wrongly judging your life badly.
    - Not sufficient: you can judge your life great but be emotionally miserable.

### 6.4 Connection to Central vs Peripheral Affects

- **Emotional affirmation**, for Haybron, is about your **central emotional condition**:
  - Long-term patterns of **attunement, engagement, endorsement**.
- A person might:
  - **Think** life is good (cognitive affirmation),
  - And have many **peripheral pleasures** (nice meals, entertainment),
  - But still **lack central emotional affirmation** (be anxious, compressed, unfulfilled).
- Such a person is **not genuinely happy** in Haybron’s sense.

These notes cover:

- The **three dimensions of happiness** and key examples.
- **Compression**, its relation to stress, FOMO, “junk activities,” and central vs peripheral affective states.
- Why **attunement is the most important dimension**.
- **Cognitive vs emotional (psychic) affirmation**, how they relate, and how they can come apart.
