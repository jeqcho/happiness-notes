## 1. The Four Noble Truths (Pali Canon)

### 1.1 First Noble Truth: There is Suffering (Dukkha)

- “Suffering” (dukkha) includes:
  - Obvious pain: illness, loss, conflict, aging, death.
  - Mental distress: worry, frustration, disappointment.
  - Subtle “unsatisfactoriness”: even good things don’t fully satisfy and don’t last.

- Key idea: Recurring suffering is inevitable as long as we live with ignorance and attachment.
- WHY internalizing this can reduce suffering:
  - Lowers unrealistic expectations (“life should always be pleasant”).
  - Makes difficulties feel less personal (“this is part of human life, not uniquely my failure”).
  - Helps you respond wisely instead of with shock and resentment.

### 1.2 Second Noble Truth: Suffering is Caused by Desire

- More precisely: suffering is caused by craving/attachment (clinging), not by all desire.
  - Craving = a needy, grasping “I must have / this must not be taken from me.”
  - Forms: craving for pleasure, status, permanence, control, or even annihilation of what we dislike.

- How craving produces suffering:
  - Wanting what we don’t have → frustration, envy, discontent.
  - Having what we want but fearing loss → anxiety.
  - Losing what we’re attached to → grief, rage, despair.
  - Hating what is present (pain, insult, injustice) → internal torment.

- Objection: “It’s not the wanting; it’s the not having.”
  - Buddhist reply:
    - If you satisfy one craving, new ones arise. The basic restless structure of craving remains.
    - You can test this: recall a big thing you once thought would “complete” you. Did it end dissatisfaction?

- Objection: “Desire doesn’t cause all suffering. What about physical pain?”
  - Distinction: physical/initial pain vs mental suffering about it.

#### The Two Darts of Suffering

- First dart: unavoidable unpleasant experience (e.g., injury, illness, insult).
- Second dart: the extra mental layer:
  - Resistance: “This must not be happening to me.”
  - Clinging to a narrative: “I’m ruined; my life is over; they can’t treat me like this.”
  - Fear, resentment, self-pity, rumination.
- Buddhism claims:
  - We usually can’t avoid the first dart, but we can greatly reduce or drop the second dart.
  - Craving/aversion produce the second dart; weakening them reduces overall suffering, even with the same external pain.

### 1.3 Third Noble Truth: To Eliminate Suffering, Eliminate Desire (Craving)

- Not: eliminate all goals, plans, or ordinary preferences.
- Instead: eliminate attachment/clinging:
  - Let go of the “my happiness/identity depends on this” attitude.
  - Accept impermanence and lack of full control.

- Objection: “If I eliminate desire, I’ll do nothing and die.”
  - Reply via distinction:
    - You can still have:
      - Preferences
      - Commitments
      - Projects
    - but without *clinging* to outcomes.
  - You still act wisely and energetically—but with less fear, anger, and desperation.
  - Motivation shifts from craving and anxiety → clarity, compassion, and wise intention.

### 1.4 Fourth Noble Truth: The Eightfold Path as the Cure

- The Eightfold Path is the training that gradually:
  - Weakens craving, hatred, and delusion.
  - Cultivates wisdom, ethical conduct, and mental discipline.

- Three broad areas:
  - Wisdom: seeing reality clearly (e.g., impermanence, not-self, cause-and-effect).
  - Ethical conduct: speech, action, and livelihood that reduce harm and agitation.
  - Mental training: effort, mindfulness, and concentration to steady the mind.

- For this course: main takeaway
  - The path is a *practice* for transforming how the mind relates to experience.
  - End goal: a mind that does not cling—hence no second dart; profound peace (nirvana).

---

## 2. Preference vs Attachment (Craving / Clinging)

### 2.1 Mere Preference

- A calm, flexible inclination:
  - “I’d rather X than Y.”
  - You care and act to achieve X, but your basic well-being does **not** feel at stake.
- Features:
  - If blocked, you feel some disappointment but can adapt.
  - You don’t need to distort reality to protect the preference.
  - You can enjoy success without terror of losing it.

- Examples:
  - Preferring one dessert over another.
  - Wanting to do well on an exam, but if you don’t, you learn and move on.

---

### 2.2 Attachment (Clinging, Craving)

- Rigid, needy stance:
  - “I MUST have this; I CANNOT be okay without it.”
  - Often tied to identity or self-worth: “If I fail at this, I’m worthless.”

- Signs of attachment:
  - Strong anxiety about losing the object (person, status, achievement, comfort).
  - Intense anger when frustrated.
  - Obsessive rumination.
  - Inability to accept change; heavy fear of impermanence.

- Examples:
  - Needing others’ approval to feel okay.
  - Being unable to tolerate the idea of aging, career failure, or relationship change.

- Pali Canon link:
  - “Mind precedes all mental states; if with an impure mind one acts, suffering follows.”
  - An “impure” mind = full of greed, hatred, and delusion—i.e., forms of attachment and aversion.

---

### 2.3 Why Attachment Causes Suffering, Preference Does Not

- Preference:
  - You can lose what you prefer and still fundamentally accept reality.
  - Emotional response ≈ sadness or disappointment, but not ongoing torture.

- Attachment:
  - Turns natural desire into a second dart.
  - Leads you to replay injuries and insults mentally (“He hurt me, he wronged me”), keeping hatred alive.
  - Creates constant vulnerability: any threat to the attachment shakes your whole sense of self.

- Buddhist strategy:
  - Keep preferences and wholesome aims.
  - Drop the inner *grip*—the thought that your worth or possibility of peace depends on specific outcomes.

## 3. Practicing Letting Go (Non-Clinging) & the Lake Metaphor

### 3.1 What Letting Go Is (and Is Not)

- Letting go:
  - Releasing your *mental grip* on thoughts, emotions, and outcomes.
  - Allowing experiences to arise and pass without insisting they stay or go.
  - Not a form of repression; you’re not denying or pushing away feelings.

- Not:
  - Apathy or indifference.
  - Forcing yourself not to feel.
  - Pretending “I don’t care” while secretly clinging.

---

### 3.2 Practical Steps: How to Practice Non-Clinging

**Step 1: Notice**

- Become aware of:
  - Thoughts: “I can’t stand this,” “I need them to respect me.”
  - Emotions: tightness, anxiety, anger, craving.
  - Body sensations: tension in jaw, chest, stomach.

- Key stance: curious, non-judgmental observation—“What is present right now?”

---

**Step 2: Gently Release / Let Go**

- With a thought or emotion:
  - Name it: “thinking,” “worrying,” “anger is here.”
  - See it as a passing event, not as “me” or as absolute truth.
  - Mentally loosen your grip:
    - “I don’t have to follow this thought.”
    - “This feeling can be here without me acting it out.”
- For cravings:
  - Acknowledge: “Craving is present.”
  - Notice the urge in the body; watch it peak and pass like a wave.
  - Don’t feed it with stories (“I deserve this,” “Just one more.”).

- For aversion:
  - Notice the “NO” reaction.
  - Allow the discomfort (first dart), but drop the extra “This must not be!” commentary.

---

**Step 3: Repeat, Patiently**

- This is a skill; repetition is essential.
- Start with small, everyday attachments:
  - Annoyance in traffic.
  - Desire to check your phone.
  - Mild envy or insecurity.
- Also avoid growing new attachments:
  - Don’t dwell on slights, build revenge fantasies, or constantly replay praise.

---

### 3.3 The Lake Metaphor

- Ideal mind = calm, clear lake:
  - Surface is mostly still, reflecting the world accurately.
  - Not constantly churned up by storms of craving, fear, or hatred.
  - When disturbed, it settles naturally once the wind dies down.

- Emotions/thoughts = wind and waves:
  - Hatred, injustice, fear, anxiety: strong winds that create rough waves.
  - If you cling or resist, you keep stirring the water.
  - If you let go—don’t grasp, don’t push away—mental “wind” decreases and the lake settles.

- Takeaway:
  - Goal is not to suppress all waves, but to:
    - Not dwell on them.
    - Not identify with them.
    - Allow the mind to return to stillness more quickly.

## 4. Awareness Without Resistance: “Don’t Cling, Don’t Push Away, Don’t Ignore”

This is a concise formula for how to relate to any experience (thought, emotion, sensation) in awareness.

### 4.1 Don’t Cling

- With pleasant experiences:
  - Enjoy them fully, but recognize they are impermanent.
  - Avoid “I must keep this feeling/person/status forever.”
- With neutral or unpleasant experiences:
  - Don’t cling to self-centered stories:
    - “I am this depression.”
    - “I will always be a failure.”

- In practice:
  - Notice when you want to *hold on* (to praise, pleasure, comfort).
  - Acknowledge the wish, then let the object/event come and go.
  - Remember: clinging is what turns change into suffering.

---

### 4.2 Don’t Push Away (No Resistance / No Aversion)

- With pain, fear, sadness, or insult:
  - Allow the first dart: “This hurts.”
  - Drop the second dart: “This is unbearable; it shouldn’t be happening; I hate these people.”
- Non-hatred:
  - Buddhist teaching: hatred is never ended by more hatred; it ends by non-hatred.
  - If you replay “He abused me, he harmed me,” hatred continues.
  - If you stop harbouring those thoughts, hatred naturally fades.

- In practice:
  - When something unpleasant arises, mentally say “Let it be here” for a few breaths.
  - Feel it in the body without immediately reacting or distracting yourself.
  - Watch resistance as just another experience you can allow and release.

---

### 4.3 Don’t Ignore (Don’t Numb Out / Don’t Space Out)

- Ignoring = a third unhelpful strategy:
  - Zoning out, distraction, denial, refusal to look.
  - This allows hidden attachments and fears to keep driving behaviour unconsciously.

- Why non-ignoring matters:
  - You need awareness to see craving and aversion clearly.
  - Only what is seen can be let go.
  - The Pali canon emphasizes seeing what is truly essential vs unessential—this requires clear attention.

- In practice:
  - Notice impulses to escape: compulsive scrolling, overeating, mindless TV, etc.
  - Instead, stay with your actual experience for a bit:
    - “Loneliness is here.”
    - “Boredom is here.”
  - Observe without judgment; this itself weakens their power.

---

### 4.4 Summary: Awareness Without Resistance

- For any experience, apply all three:

1. **Don’t Cling**
   - No grasping, no “I must have/keep this.”
2. **Don’t Push Away**
   - No war against what’s already here; allow it to be felt.
3. **Don’t Ignore**
   - Don’t go numb; stay gently aware.

- Result:
  - You still experience life fully—including joy and pain—
  - But you greatly reduce the second dart of mental suffering.
  - Over time, the mind becomes like a well-built house or a calm lake:
    - Less easily shaken by passion and hatred.
    - More stable, clear, and capable of genuine happiness.
