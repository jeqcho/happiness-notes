# The Pali Canon (Buddhism) – Exam Preparation Notes

---

## 1. The Four Noble Truths

### 1.1 The Structure: Disease, Cause, Cure, Path
1. **There is suffering** (the disease)  
2. **Suffering is caused by desire** (the cause)  
3. **To eliminate suffering, eliminate desire** (the cure)  
4. **The Eightfold Path eliminates desire** (the path)

You do **not** need detailed Eightfold Path content here; just know it is the method of mental/ethical training that gradually removes craving.

### 1.2 First Noble Truth: There is Suffering

- Buddhism claims: **recurring suffering is inevitable until nirvana**.  
- “Suffering” (Pali: *dukkha*) = not only intense pain, but:
  - dissatisfaction, restlessness, anxiety  
  - the fact that pleasant things are fragile and pass away  
  - a subtle sense that things are “not quite right” or secure  

**Why internalizing this can reduce suffering:**
- Lowers **unrealistic expectations** (e.g., that life should be smooth and always pleasant).  
- When pain, loss, or frustration occur, you are **less shocked and outraged** (“This shouldn’t be happening!”), which reduces secondary distress.  
- Knowing “suffering is part of human life” can:
  - make it less personal (“not just me, this is the condition of beings”)  
  - encourage compassion for yourself and others  
  - motivate practice rather than resentment  

Key idea: accepting the reality of suffering **prevents extra mental resistance**, which itself is a major source of misery.

### 1.3 Second Noble Truth: Suffering is Caused by Desire

Here “desire” primarily means **craving / clinging**: intense, grasping “I must have this / I cannot bear losing that.”

**Mechanism:**
- Wanting what you don’t have → frustration, envy, restlessness.  
- Getting what you want doesn’t settle things:
  - pleasure fades  
  - new desires arise  
  - fear of loss appears  
- So craving keeps the mind agitated and never satisfied.

#### Objection: “It’s not the wanting; it’s the not having.”
- Claim: the problem is simply deprivation; if we got what we wanted, no problem.

**Reply: Having would not solve the problem**
- Many people get what they think they need and **remain dissatisfied**:
  - wanting more, or better  
  - fearing loss  
  - adapting quickly so the thing no longer feels special  
- Buddhism: the root problem is the **mental habit of craving**, not any particular object.

> Suggested method: **personal experiment** – carefully observe:
> - your mood while strongly wanting something  
> - your mood after you get it, over time  
> - whether craving actually brings lasting peace or more restlessness.

#### Objection: “Desire causes some suffering, but not all (e.g. physical pain).”

**Reply: The Two Darts of Suffering**
- **First dart**: unavoidable, physical or immediate pain  
  - e.g., illness, injury, hearing bad news  
- **Second dart**: our **mental reaction**:
  - anger, resentment, “Why me?”, self-pity, fear, replaying the event  
  - this is fueled by craving (wanting reality to be other than it is)  
- Buddhism: we may not avoid the first dart, but we can **minimize or avoid the second** by changing how we relate to desire and aversion.

So “suffering is caused by desire” is mainly about reducing or eliminating the **second dart** and the ongoing dissatisfaction that craving generates.

### 1.4 Third Noble Truth: To Eliminate Suffering, Eliminate Desire

- If craving is the **root** of ongoing suffering, then eliminating craving eliminates that suffering.
- This does **not** mean:
  - becoming a rock or a zombie  
  - losing all motivation, care, or enjoyment  
- It means eliminating **clinging** (obsessive, possessive, “must-have” attitude).

This leads directly to the key distinction: **attachment vs mere preference** (next section).

---

## 2. Preference vs Attachment (Clinging / Craving)

The worry: “If I eliminate desire, I’ll do nothing and die.”

Buddhist reply: distinguish **attachment** (harmful) from **preference** (healthy).

### 2.1 Attachment / Clinging / Craving

- A **grasping, rigid** mental attitude:
  - “I absolutely must get this”  
  - “I cannot be OK if I lose this”  
  - “This outcome defines my worth / safety / happiness.”  
- Involves **identifying** with desires and fears:
  - “If this fails, I’m a failure.”  
- Consequences:
  - anxiety before events  
  - anger and despair when blocked  
  - ongoing fear of loss even when you have what you want  
- This is what Buddhism targets for elimination.

### 2.2 Mere Preference / Intention / Project

- A **calmer, flexible** mental attitude:
  - “I’d like this to happen; I’ll act toward it.”  
  - “If it doesn’t work out, that’s unfortunate, but I’ll be OK.”  
- You still:
  - have goals and plans  
  - care about people and projects  
  - act with energy and commitment  
- But your **basic well-being** does not hinge on success.

### 2.3 Why Preference Is Compatible with Buddhist Practice

- You can **pursue goals** (health, education, justice, kindness) with preference, not clinging.
- You can **love others deeply** without making their behavior your rigid condition for being OK.
- Buddhism aims to transform:
  - **From**: possessiveness, desperation, identity wrapped up in outcomes  
  - **To**: caring engagement without inner compulsion

So the claim: **eliminate attachment**, not all desires. This removes much suffering but preserves meaningful, motivated action.

## 3. Practicing Letting Go (Non-Clinging) and the Lake Metaphor

Non-clinging is a **practical skill**: learning to release thoughts, emotions, and sensations instead of gripping them or pushing them away.

### 3.1 Basic Two-Step Practice

**Step 1: Notice**
- Become aware of:
  - a craving (“I need them to like me”)  
  - an aversion (“I can’t stand this discomfort”)  
  - a repetitive thought (“He hurt me…”)
- Key: see it as **a mental event**, not a command:
  - “This is a thought / feeling appearing in the mind.”

**Step 2: Let Go / Release**
- Gently **relax the mental grip**:
  - don’t feed the story, don’t rehearse it  
  - drop the chewing-over, even for a moment  
- You **let the thought or feeling be there** without:
  - adding commentary  
  - acting it out  
  - identifying with it (“this is me”).  
- If it comes back (it will), repeat:
  - notice → relax → return to simple awareness (e.g., breath, body).

This is a **repeated experiment**, not a one-time decision.

### 3.2 What Letting Go Is Not

- Not suppressing (“I must not feel this!”).  
- Not pretending it’s fine when it isn’t.  
- Not becoming indifferent or uncaring.

It is **changing your relationship** to experiences: from gripping and resisting to allowing and observing.

### 3.3 Start with Weaker Attachments

- Strong attachments (to identity, close relationships, big fears) are hardest.
- Begin with small ones:
  - mild impatience when waiting  
  - slight annoyance at noise  
  - urge to check your phone  
- Practice noticing and releasing those first. This:
  - builds skill and confidence  
  - makes it easier later with deeper patterns.

Also: avoid **cultivating new attachments** (e.g., don’t habitually feed resentment, bragging, envy in your thoughts).

### 3.4 The Lake Metaphor

Ideal mind = **a calm, clear, still lake**.

- Normally, mind is like **choppy water**:
  - waves of craving, fear, anger, anxiety  
  - constant stirring by thoughts and reactions  
- With practice:
  - disturbances (waves) still **arise**, but  
  - the “lake” no longer amplifies or clings to them.  
- Thoughts, feelings, and sensations:
  - appear like ripples  
  - are seen clearly  
  - then naturally fade without being chased or resisted.

A calm lake:
- reflects things accurately (clear perception, wisdom)  
- is not **dominated** by storms (strong emotions) even when surface ripples occur.

## 4. Awareness Without Resistance:
### “Don’t Cling, Don’t Push Away, Don’t Ignore”

This is a practical summary of the attitude to cultivate.

### 4.1 Don’t Cling (No Grasping)

- When something pleasant arises (praise, pleasure, good mood):
  - notice the urge to hold onto it (“I need this to last!”)  
  - instead, allow it to be pleasant **without** grabbing it.
- Consequence of clinging:
  - fear of loss  
  - jealousy, possessiveness  
  - disappointment when it inevitably changes.

In the readings:  
- Acting with a **pure mind** (free of grasping, hatred, delusion) → happiness follows “like your shadow.”  
- Clinging to grudges (“He abused me, he struck me…”) → hatred does not end.

### 4.2 Don’t Push Away (No Aversion / Resistance)

- When something unpleasant arises (pain, criticism, boredom):
  - avoid adding “I cannot bear this!” or rage.  
  - let the unpleasant sensation or emotion **be there** without extra hostility.
- This addresses the **second dart**:
  - you still feel the first dart (pain, loss)  
  - but you don’t add resistance, hatred, or self-attack.

In the readings:
- “Hatred is never appeased by hatred; by non-hatred alone is hatred appeased.”  
- Recognizing mortality (“we all must die”) helps people settle quarrels, letting go of hostility.

### 4.3 Don’t Ignore (No Numbing / Distraction)

- Avoid simply **shutting down**:
  - compulsive distraction  
  - denial (“this isn’t happening”)  
  - emotional numbness
- Ignoring prevents:
  - learning from experience  
  - seeing how craving and aversion operate  
  - genuine letting go, because you never fully acknowledge what is there.

So the recommended stance is **open awareness**:
- fully aware of what is arising (pleasant, unpleasant, neutral)  
- without:
  - clinging to it  
  - pushing it away  
  - spacing out or denying it.

### 4.4 Meditation Experiments (The “Six Nails” Theme)

You don’t need technical details, but understand the **task description**:

- Sit quietly and observe whatever arises in body and mind.  
- Apply the threefold instruction:
  - **Don’t cling** to pleasant sensations or thoughts.  
  - **Don’t push away** unpleasant ones.  
  - **Don’t ignore** neutral or subtle ones; remain present.  
- This is like “nailing down” the mind in the present, so it doesn’t:
  - rush after desire  
  - run away in aversion  
  - drift into dullness.

Repeated practice gradually:
- weakens attachment and aversion  
- clarifies the mind (like improving the thatched roof so rain [passion] can’t penetrate)  
- supports living with virtue and non-hatred (as praised in the readings).

### Core Takeaways for the Exam

- **Four Noble Truths**: suffering, its cause in craving, its cessation via ending craving, and the path as the method.  
- **Suffering vs desire**: distinguish first and second dart; recognize *dukkha* as pervasive dissatisfaction.  
- **Preference vs attachment**: eliminate clinging, not all desires; you can act and care without inner compulsion.  
- **Letting go**: notice → release; start with small attachments; aim for a mind like a calm lake.  
- **Awareness without resistance**: “Don’t cling, don’t push away, don’t ignore” is the central practice attitude that reduces the second dart and leads toward lasting peace.
