## 1. Mencius’ Central Thesis: Human Nature Is Good

**Claim:**  
All humans have an **innate tendency toward goodness**.  
More specifically: every person has at least a **“sprout” of benevolence** (compassion).

- “Nature is good” = our inborn dispositions, if properly developed, **lead toward virtue**, not toward cruelty.
- Bad behavior is explained by **obstruction, damage, or lack of cultivation**, not by an evil nature.

---

## 2. The Sprout of Benevolence (and the Other Sprouts)

Mencius thinks we are born with small, natural moral “sprouts” that can grow into full virtues:

1. **Sprout of benevolence (humaneness):**
   - A “mind of pity and commiseration” – immediate compassion for others’ suffering.
   - This is the key focus for the exam.

2. (For context – briefly)
   - Sprout of **shame/disgust** → rightness
   - Sprout of **reverence/respect** → propriety
   - Sprout of **judgment about right and wrong** → wisdom  

These are **not given from outside**; they are **in us by nature**.  
But they are **tiny** like sprouts: can grow or wither.

## 3. Mencius’ Main Arguments that Human Nature Is Good

### 3.1 Child-at-the-Well Thought Experiment

**Setup:**
- You suddenly see a small child about to fall into a well.

**Mencius’ claim:**
- Any normal person will instantly feel **alarm and compassion**.
- This feeling arises:
  - **Spontaneously**
  - **Before** any calculation of:
    - Gaining praise
    - Avoiding blame
    - Getting a reward
- So the **best explanation** is: humans have a **natural compassionate reaction**.

**Moral:**
- This shows a basic **benevolent sprout** in everyone.
- Not everyone will actually save the child (fear, cowardice, etc.), but the **initial feeling** reveals our nature.

### 3.2 King-and-the-Ox Case

**Setup:**
- A king orders an ox to be taken to sacrifice (to be killed).
- He sees the ox trembling with fear.
- He **spares** the ox and orders a sheep to be used instead.

**Mencius’ interpretation:**
- The king’s decision is motivated by **pity** for the ox’s visible fear.
- This shows the king **has benevolence**.
- His problem is not lack of a good nature, but **failure to extend** this compassion from the ox to his **suffering people**.

**Moral:**
- Even rulers who behave badly still show **moments of compassion**.
- This supports the claim that **all humans** have benevolent sprouts.

### 3.3 Water Analogy

Opponent (Gaozi):  
- Human nature is like water flowing east or west—can go any way; neither good nor bad.

Mencius’ reply:
- True: water doesn’t care about east vs. west.
- But water **naturally flows downward**.
- Only by **force** (splashing, pumping, damming) can you make water go upward.
- Likewise:
  - Humans **naturally tend toward goodness**.
  - People can be forced, corrupted, or channeled into bad behavior, but that is **against their nature**.

### 3.4 Barley Analogy

- Plant barley in similar soil at the same time:
  - In general, the barley **all grows** in similar ways.
  - Differences in outcome depend on **sun, rain, and care**, not different “barley natures.”
- Likewise:
  - Humans share a **common nature**.
  - Differences in virtue arise from **environment and cultivation**, not different basic natures.

**Conclusion:**  
These analogies together support: our **default tendency is toward goodness**, unless blocked or damaged.

## 4. The Egoist’s Alternative View

**Egoist (psychological egoist) view:**
- All human actions are ultimately **self-interested**.
- There is **no genuine benevolence**; apparent concern for others is always:
  - For pleasure, reputation, social approval
  - To avoid guilt or blame
  - To secure future benefits

So, egoists deny:
- That we have **any truly other-regarding motives**.
- That compassion is **fundamental** rather than a tool for self-interest.

---

## 5. Egoist’s Objection to Mencius’ Argument (Motivation Focus)

### 5.1 Egoist Reading of Child at the Well

Egoist might say:

- When you see the child:
  - You imagine being **blamed** if you do nothing.
  - You feel **distress** because you don’t like seeing suffering.
  - You want to **avoid guilt** or preserve a good **self-image**.
- So your motive is really:
  - To protect your **own feelings**
  - To preserve your **reputation**
  - To avoid **future regret**

Thus, the egoist claims:
- Your concern is really **about yourself**, not about the child.

### 5.2 Egoist Reading of King and the Ox

- The king spares the ox to **avoid feeling bad** about watching its suffering, or to appear **merciful** to his court.
- Again: the motive is **self-directed**, not compassion for the ox as such.

---

## 6. How Mencius Might Reply to the Egoist (Motivation)

### 6.1 Immediate Reaction vs. Calculated Self-Interest

Mencius emphasizes **timing and phenomenology**:

- The compassionate impulse is:
  - **Instantaneous**
  - **Pre-reflective**: occurs before any thinking about reputation, blame, future feelings.
- When you see the child:
  - You feel an **immediate “shock” of pity**.
  - You don’t first think: “I might be blamed; I’d better help.”
- Best explanation:
  - The **child’s danger itself** moves you.
  - Your **attention is on the child**, not your own advantage.

So:
- Even if you later notice that helping feels good, the **primary motive** is the **child’s safety**, not your own gain.

### 6.2 Distinguishing Side Effects from Motives

- It’s true that:
  - Helping others often makes you feel good.
  - Not helping can lead to guilt.
- But this doesn’t show the **motive** is self-interest.
- Analogy:  
  - You may get paid for doing work you value.
  - The **existence of a paycheck** doesn’t prove money is your **only** or **main** motive.
- For Mencius:
  - We have **genuine concern for others**.
  - The fact that this concern is **pleasant** or **rewarded** is a **side-effect**, not the **essence** of the motivation.

### 6.3 Internal vs. External Origin of Moral Feelings

- Mencius argues that key moral feelings (pity, shame, respect, judgment) are **internal**:
  - They **arise from our own minds**, not imposed from outside.
- This suggests:
  - The emotional push to help others is a **basic feature** of human psychology, not merely a tool we use for selfish ends.

**Overall reply:**  
The **best explanation** of our immediate, uncalculated reactions in Mencius’ examples is that we possess a **genuine, intrinsic sprout of benevolence**, not that we are purely self-interested.

## 7. Objection: If We’re Naturally Good, Why Do We Sometimes Act Badly?

### Objection

- If human nature is good and we have benevolent sprouts:
  - Why do people so often act **selfishly, cruelly, or indifferently**?
  - Why do we sometimes **fail** to help when we clearly could?

### Reply #1: Sprouts Can Be Overwhelmed

Mencius: what is **in our nature** can be **blocked or overwhelmed**.

- Hunger, fear, greed, social pressure, bad education:
  - Can **suppress** the compassionate impulse.
- Analogy to **water**:
  - Water naturally flows down.
  - Yet with **dams, channels, force**, it can be made to go uphill.
  - That doesn’t change water’s **basic tendency**.
- So:
  - Wrongdoing shows **obstacles** to our natural goodness, not the absence of it.

### Reply #2: Sprouts Require Cultivation

Mencius: moral sprouts are like **young plants**:

- They start small and **need care**:
  - Good upbringing
  - Good social environment
  - Reflection and practice
- Without cultivation, sprouts:
  - **Wither**, become weak
  - Can be almost unrecognizable

Analogy: **Ox Mountain**

- Once a beautiful forest.
- After repeated cutting and grazing, it becomes barren.
- People then say: “It’s just a barren mountain by nature.”
- But its barrenness is due to **damage**, not its **original nature**.

Similarly:
- People may appear to lack goodness because their moral sprouts have been **repeatedly “cut down”**.
- This does not show they never had them.

---

## 8. Objection: What About People Who Seem Completely Cruel?

### Objection

- Some people seem to show **no benevolence at all**:
  - Cruel tyrants
  - Serial abusers
- Doesn’t this disprove Mencius’ claim that **everyone** has benevolent sprouts?

### Mencius’ Reply

- Even the worst people once had **sprouts**; but:
  - They were **neglected**,
  - **Overwhelmed** by bad influences,
  - Or **systematically destroyed**, like trees on Ox Mountain.
- There is **no one** who entirely lacks the basic capacities for:
  - Pity
  - Shame
  - Respect
  - Moral judgment
- Extreme vice is like a plant:
  - So damaged it no longer looks like a plant.
  - The original nature has been **corrupted**, not absent from birth.

**Key idea:**  
Differences in virtue reflect **degree of development** of a shared good nature, not fundamentally different kinds of nature.

## 9. Extending Benevolence: The Work of a Lifetime

### 9.1 Natural Starting Point: Partial Benevolence

- Our benevolence is most obvious toward:
  - Family
  - Close friends
- We naturally care **more** about those close to us.

Mencius’ project:
- **Extend** this benevolence:
  - From family → neighbors → citizens → all humans (and even animals).
- Not making us love everyone equally, but:
  - Making us **consistently** acknowledge others’ humanity and worth.

### 9.2 How to Extend Benevolence

Key methods:
- **Reflection**:
  - Notice your reactions (like pity for the child or ox).
  - Realize these show your **true nature**.
- **Practice**:
  - Repeatedly act on your benevolent impulses.
  - Gradually widen the circle of those you treat humanely.
- **Environment**:
  - Seek good teachers, rituals, laws, and institutions that **support** benevolent behavior.

Over time:
- The small sprout becomes a **strong, stable virtue**.
- You come to feel **genuine concern** for a wide range of people, not just your inner circle.

### 9.3 The Farmer Who Pulled Up His Plants

Story:
- A farmer is eager for his crops to grow.
- He **pulls the plants upward** to “help” them grow faster.
- They all wither and die.

Mencius’ point:
- Moral growth must be **gradual and organic**.
- Two mistakes to avoid:
  1. **Neglect**: never working on moral cultivation → sprouts wither.
  2. **Forcing**: harsh, artificial methods; expecting instant sainthood → damages moral life.

Proper approach:
- Provide **regular nourishment** (good habits, learning, reflection).
- Be **patient** with the process of extending benevolence.

- **Key arguments**:
  - **Child at the well**: spontaneous compassion shows innate benevolence, not calculated self-interest.
  - **King and the ox**: even flawed rulers show moments of pity; problem is failure to **extend** their compassion.
