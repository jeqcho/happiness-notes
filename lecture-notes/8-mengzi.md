## 1. Mencius’ Central Thesis: Human Nature Is Good

- Claim: Human nature is **good** in the sense that:
  - All humans have an **innate tendency** toward moral goodness.
  - Specifically, we all have at least the **“sprout” (beginning) of benevolence**.
- “Good” here does **not** mean:
  - Everyone is already virtuous.
  - No one ever acts badly.
- It means:
  - Everyone has **built‑in moral capacities** that, if properly developed, can grow into full virtue.

---

## 2. The Sprout of Benevolence

- **Benevolence (ren)** = compassion, concern for others’ well-being.
- A **“sprout”** is:
  - A small, initial tendency or capacity.
  - Needs **nourishment and cultivation** to grow.
- Mencius thinks everyone has:
  - At least a **sprout of benevolence** (concern for others).
  - (He also mentions sprouts of shame, respect, and right/wrong, but for this exam focus on benevolence.)

Key idea:  
Even if people often act selfishly, there is a **natural, spontaneous capacity** in everyone to feel concern for others.

## 3. Mencius’ Arguments for Innate Goodness

### 3.1 Thought Experiment: The Child at the Well

**Setup**

- Imagine you suddenly see a small child on the verge of falling into a well.

**Mencius’ claim about our reaction**

- Any normal human would feel:
  - **Alarm and distress**.
  - Immediate urge: “Someone must save that child!”
- Crucial point: This reaction is:
  - **Immediate**, not calculated.
  - Present **even if**:
    - You do not know the child.
    - There is no chance of reward.
    - No one else will see what you do.
    - Helping could even be costly or risky to you.

**Argument structure**

1. We all have spontaneous feelings of **compassion** in such cases.
2. These feelings are **not best explained** as self-interested calculations.
3. The best explanation: we have an **innate sprout of benevolence**.
4. Therefore, **human nature includes an innate tendency toward goodness**.

### 3.2 Thought Experiment: The King and the Ox

**Story**

- A king orders an ox to be led to slaughter for a ritual.
- Seeing the ox trembling with fear, he **cannot bear its suffering**.
- He spares the ox and orders a sheep to be used instead (which he does not see).

**Mencius’ interpretation**

- The king’s reaction shows:
  - A natural **compassion** when suffering is **vividly presented** to him.
- Mencius tells the king:
  - This is the **same kind of feeling** needed to be a benevolent ruler.
  - He already has the **sprout of benevolence**.
  - He merely fails to **extend** it:
    - From an ox he sees → to his people whose suffering he doesn’t see as vividly.

**Role in Mencius’ theory**

- Again, best explanation of the king’s reaction:
  - He has an **innate compassionate tendency**, not merely a calculated self-interest.
- Supports claim: **everyone**, including rulers, has some **natural benevolent motivation**.

---

### 3.3 Other Analogies Supporting Innate Goodness (Brief)

- **Water analogy**: Water naturally flows **downward**; it can be forced upward, but that’s not its nature.  
  Similarly:
  - Humans naturally tend toward **goodness**.
  - They can be pushed into bad behavior by external forces, but this does **not** change their underlying nature.
- **Barley analogy**: Same kind of seed, same soil, same time will normally all grow; differences in outcome come from **differences in environment and cultivation**, not from different “natures.”
  - Likewise, all humans share a **common good nature**, even if outcomes vary.

---

## 4. The Egoist’s Alternative View

### 4.1 Egoist’s Basic View of Human Nature

- Human beings are, deep down, **self-interested**.
- When people act “morally,” they are really:
  - Seeking **pleasure**, **advantage**, **security**, or **reputation**.
  - Avoiding **pain**, **guilt**, or **punishment**.
- So:
  - Human nature is **not good** (not fundamentally benevolent).
  - At best, it is **neutral** or driven by **self-interest**.

---

### 4.2 Egoist’s Objection to the Child-at-the-Well Argument

**Egoist reinterpretation**

- When you feel alarm/distress seeing the child:
  - You anticipate:
    - **Feeling bad** (guilty) if you do nothing.
    - **Social blame** or loss of reputation if people find out you didn’t help.
  - You feel **uncomfortable** watching suffering.
- Therefore:
  - Your impulse to help is really:
    - A desire to **stop your own discomfort**.
    - A desire to **protect your reputation**.
  - That is **self-interest**, not genuine concern for the child.

---

### 4.3 Egoist’s Objection to the King-and-Ox Case

**Egoist reinterpretation**

- The king is disturbed by the **unpleasant sight** of the trembling ox.
- Sparing the ox:
  - Relieves **his own emotional discomfort**.
- He switches to a sheep he doesn’t see:
  - Suggests he cares mainly about **avoiding a disturbing scene**, not about the animal’s suffering.
- Therefore, egoist says:
  - This is still **self-regarding**, not genuine benevolence.

---

## 5. Mencius’ Replies to the Egoist (Focus on Motivation)

### 5.1 Phenomenology of the Emotion

- Mencius emphasizes:
  - The **felt character** of the reaction in the child-at-the-well case:
    - You are focused on the **child’s danger**, not on “my reputation” or “my comfort.”
- The **natural interpretation** of your own experience:
  - “I am worried about what is happening to the child.”
  - This looks like a **genuinely other-regarding concern**, not a disguised self-interest.

---

### 5.2 Original Impulse vs Later Reflection

- Mencius can distinguish:
  - **Original motive**: immediate compassion for the child or ox.
  - **Additional thoughts**: about reputation, rewards, or guilt that might come later.
- Claim:
  - The **sprout of benevolence** is seen in the **first, uncalculated reaction**.
  - Even if we later notice side benefits, this does not show that the **original cause** was self-interest.

---

### 5.3 Counterexamples to Pure Egoism

- People sometimes:
  - **Accept serious risks or sacrifices** to save others, with **no chance** of reward or praise.
  - Still feel they **ought** to help, and **would be ashamed** not to.
- Mencian reading:
  - This shame is tied to an **internal standard of rightness**, not just fear of external punishment.
  - Shows we value **rightness and benevolence** more than mere self-preservation in some cases.

---

### 5.4 Best Explanation Argument

- Both sides admit:
  - We have certain emotional reactions (alarm, distress, “cannot bear” others’ suffering).
- Question: **What best explains these reactions?**
  - Egoist: pure self-interest.
  - Mencius: an **innate benevolent tendency**.
- Mencius’ position:
  - Self-interest may often **accompany** our actions.
  - But it **cannot fully explain**:
    - The immediacy.
    - The universality.
    - The willingness sometimes to act **against** self-interest.
  - Therefore, the best explanation is that we have a **real sprout of benevolence**.

---

## 6. Objection: If Nature Is Good, Why So Much Non‑Benevolent Behavior?

### Objection

- People often:
  - Ignore suffering.
  - Exploit, harm, or even enjoy others’ misery.
- If our nature is really good and benevolent, **how is this possible?**

---

### Reply #1: The Good Nature Can Be Overwhelmed

- Mencius’ idea:
  - Our sprout of goodness is **not irresistible**.
  - It can be **overpowered** by:
    - Strong desires (wealth, power, pleasure).
    - Bad social conditions (poverty, war, corrupt leadership).
- Analogy:
  - Water naturally flows downward, but:
    - It can be **dammed** or **forced upward**.
    - That doesn’t change its **underlying direction**.
- Conclusion:
  - Wrong actions show that our good nature can be **blocked**, not that it doesn’t exist.

---

### Reply #2: Goodness Needs Cultivation and Can Be Damaged

- Our sprout of benevolence is like:
  - A small plant that needs **care** to grow.
- Without cultivation:
  - The sprout becomes **weak and easily destroyed**.
- Analogy: **Ox Mountain**
  - Mountain originally covered with beautiful trees.
  - Repeated cutting and grazing make it look barren.
  - People think “This mountain was always bare,” but:
    - In reality, its **original nature** included rich vegetation.
  - Likewise:
    - Repeated bad actions, social pressures, and lack of moral education:
      - “Cut down” our moral sprouts day after day.
      - Eventually, the person **appears** to have no goodness.
- Conclusion:
  - Bad behavior often results from **neglect and damage** to our sprouts, not from an originally bad nature.

---

## 7. Objection: What About People Who Show No Benevolence at All?

### Objection

- Some individuals seem:
  - Completely cruel.
  - Utterly indifferent to others’ suffering.
- Doesn’t this show that **not everyone** has a sprout of benevolence?

---

### Mencius’ Reply

1. **Appearance vs reality**
   - Like Ox Mountain:
     - The person may look morally “barren.”
     - But that doesn’t mean they **never had** a sprout.
   - Their goodness may be:
     - **Severely damaged**.
     - **Covered over** by habits, desires, or trauma.
2. **Capacity vs development**
   - Everyone has the **capacity** for benevolence.
   - But people differ greatly in:
     - How much they **develop** this capacity.
     - How much it has been **nurtured or harmed**.
3. **Degrees of difference**
   - Some people become **sages** (fully developed goodness).
   - Others develop only **a little** and act mostly selfishly.
   - These differences do **not** show different natures; they show different **levels of cultivation**.
4. **Near-animal state**
   - A person may be at “scant remove from the animals”:
     - Almost no visible benevolence.
   - Still, Mencius insists this is a result of **long-term damage**, not an absence of the original sprout.

## 8. Extending Benevolence

### 8.1 From Sprout to Full Virtue

- Having a sprout of benevolence is:
  - Only a **beginning**.
  - Full morality requires a **lifetime of cultivation**.
- Cultivation practices (general idea):
  - Reflecting on others’ situations.
  - Developing habits of considerate action.
  - Engaging in rituals and social practices that **reinforce** benevolence.

---

### 8.2 The Problem of Limited Benevolence

- Natural benevolence starts out:
  - **Partial and biased**:
    - Strongest toward family and close friends.
    - Stronger when suffering is **vividly seen** (e.g., the ox), weaker when distant or abstract.
- Challenge:
  - How to **extend** this concern:
    - From family → to wider community → to all humans (and possibly animals).

**King and the ox as example of extension**

- King already pities the ox he sees.
- Mencius urges:
  - “What you did to the ox, you can do to your people.”
  - Use the **same emotion**, but **extend its scope**:
    - From one animal → to all your subjects.

---

### 8.3 The Farmer Who Pulled Up His Plants

**Story**

- A farmer is impatient for his crops to grow.
- He goes into the field and **pulls the plants upward** to “help” them grow.
- Result:
  - The plants **wither and die**.
- He later boasts that he has “assisted their growth.”

**Moral**

- Benevolence cannot be:
  - **Forced** or **rushed** by extreme measures or harsh self-treatment.
- Proper cultivation:
  - Is like good farming:
    - Provide **nourishment** (good environment, reflection, practice).
    - Protect from **harm** (bad influences).
    - Allow **time** for natural growth.
- Wrong approach:
  - Trying to **drag oneself or others into goodness** too quickly or violently.
  - This can actually **destroy** the sprout.

---

### 8.4 Lifelong Project

- Extending benevolence is:
  - The **work of a lifetime**.
- Goal:
  - Make your natural, initial concern:
    - **Stronger** (more stable, resilient).
    - **Wider** (applies to strangers, distant people, even future generations).
- Mencius’ overall picture:
  - You start with a **small sprout** (e.g., feeling for the child at the well).
  - Through **consistent, appropriate cultivation**, this can grow into a **robust, all‑embracing benevolence**.
