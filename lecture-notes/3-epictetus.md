## Epictetus and Stoic Happiness – Exam-Focused Notes

---

## 1. The Two Parts to Living Well

### Part (1): See Clearly What Is (and Is Not) Up to You  
- Epictetus starts by dividing everything into:
  - **Up to you (within your control)**:  
    - Your judgments, beliefs, values  
    - Your decisions, choices, intentions  
    - Your desires and aversions *as you shape them*  
  - **Not up to you (outside your control)**:  
    - Your body (health, strength, aging)  
    - Possessions (wealth, property)  
    - Reputation, social status, offices  
    - How others act, what they think of you  
    - Many outcomes of your actions (success, failure, luck)

To live well, you must first grasp this distinction and take it seriously.

### Part (2): Align Your Aims with This Reality  
Epictetus’ core practical claim:

> Attach your desires and aversions only to what is up to you; accept everything else as it happens.

Concretely:
- Strongly care about:
  - Having correct judgments  
  - Making good choices  
  - Responding virtuously to circumstances  
- Do *not* strongly care about:
  - Getting or keeping particular external outcomes  
  - Avoiding all illness, poverty, death, or insult  

Instead, about externals: prefer some over others if you like, but hold them **very lightly** and accept events.

---

## 2. Justifications for Part (2): Why Align Desires Only with What’s Up to You?

Lecture mentions **four justifications** for shaping desires this way:

### (a) Argument from Peace of Mind (Avoiding Frustration)
- If you desire things **not** up to you (e.g., wealth, health, admiration):
  - Often you will fail to get them → you will be “thwarted, miserable, and upset.”
- If you desire only what **is** up to you (good judgment, virtuous response):
  - You will *never* be forced to fail → you always “get what you want” internally.
- So, for your own happiness and tranquility, you should only strongly desire what is up to you.

### (b) Argument from Freedom (No One Can Coerce You)
- “The things that are up to us are by nature free, unhindered, and unimpeded.”
- If you think externals are “yours”:
  - Anyone who controls them can manipulate you (threaten your job, reputation, life).
  - You become a **slave** to those people and circumstances.
- If you only care deeply about your own choices and judgments:
  - No one can *make* you think or will what you reject.
  - So you are free in the deepest sense.

### (c) Argument from Responsibility and Piety (Right Way to Relate to God/Nature)
- Good and bad must be **up to us** or we could not be rightly praised or blamed.
- If you treat externals as good/bad:
  - You inevitably blame other people or the gods if things go poorly.
  - This generates anger, ingratitude, and impiety.
- If you see good and bad as only in your own choices:
  - You stop blaming others.
  - You accept events as part of a larger rational order.
  - This is proper “piety”: trusting that the cosmos is arranged as it should be and focusing on your own role within it.

### (d) Argument from Truth and Realism (Living in Touch with Reality)
- **Fact:** Externals *are* outside your full control; your judgments and choices *are* the main things you can deliberately control.
- To stubbornly demand that external events match your wishes is to live in fantasy.
- Rational beings should:
  - Adjust their *wants* to fit the world,
  - Not demand that the world adjust to their wants.
- “Do not seek to have events happen as you want them to; instead want them to happen as they do happen, and your life will go well.”

## 3. What Is Up to You and What Is Not – And Is Epictetus Right?

### Epictetus’ Distinction (Simplified)
**Up to you:**
- Your *use of appearances*: how you interpret events.
- Your *assent* or refusal to assent to impressions.
- Your choices, commitments, inner attitudes.

**Not up to you:**
- External events and outcomes.
- Other people’s minds and actions.
- Many aspects of your own body and circumstances.

Illness, injury, poverty, death: harm the body or external situation, **not** your faculty of choice—unless you *choose* to interpret them as harm.

### Objections: Is He Right?
1. **Our judgments are partly shaped by things not up to us.**
   - Upbringing, trauma, culture, genetics influence what we believe and value.
   - So we don’t have *total* control over our inner life.

2. **We do have some control over “externals.”**
   - Diet/exercise affect health; effort influences career.
   - So it seems wrong to say body and property are entirely “not up to us.”

3. **Emotions seem partly outside our control.**
   - Grief, fear, anger often arise automatically.
   - Stoic ideal of perfect control may be unrealistic.

### What Is Salvageable?
Even if the strict dichotomy is too sharp, Epictetus’ **practical insight** remains powerful:

- Distinguish:
  - **What you can directly control right now** (how you respond, what you try, what you believe),
  - From what you can only influence or not control at all.
- Focus your deepest concern and energy on:
  - What you can reliably change (your attitudes, decisions, efforts).
- Treat the rest as:
  - Worth planning about,
  - But not worth *pinning your happiness* on.

So we can keep a **softened version**:
- We don’t have perfect control of our minds,
- Nor zero control of our bodies and circumstances,
- But we nevertheless have *much more* reliable control over our **inner responses** than over outcomes;
- Wise people base their happiness mainly on the former, not the latter.

## 4. Managing Desire

### The Problem: Unsatisfied Desire
Scenario: You want something and you don’t have it (love, money, success, health, respect).

Question: Is the best solution always to **try to satisfy** the desire?

Epictetus: **No.**
- Sometimes pursuing satisfaction is impossible, risky, degrading, or makes you dependent.
- Always chasing external satisfaction traps you in anxiety and frustration.

### Is Satisfying Desire Ever Best?
- **Sometimes yes:**
  - When the object is within your power, and
  - Obtaining it does not conflict with virtue (e.g., studying to learn, working to support family).
- **But often not:**
  - When the outcome depends heavily on others or luck,
  - Or when striving for it would require sacrificing integrity.

Key Stoic move:
- Instead of automatically trying to change the world to match your desire,
- Often you should **change the desire** (or weaken it) to fit the world.

### The Stoic Solution to Desire
1. **Detach strong desire from externals.**
   - For now, Epictetus even suggests *eliminating desire for externals entirely*.
   - Keep only measured impulses to act appropriately.

2. **Reserve strong desire for what is up to you:**
   - Desire to respond virtuously,
   - Desire to keep your mind “in a state conformable to nature.”

3. **Reframe situations.**
   - Instead of: “I must get X or I’ll be miserable,”
   - Say: “What matters is how I handle not having X.”

4. **Use aversion carefully.**
   - Do not fear or be averse to things not up to you (illness, poverty, death).
   - Reserve aversion for inner failures: injustice, cowardice, pettiness—things that *are* up to you.

### Bath Example
Before going to take a bath, Epictetus says to anticipate:
- People splashing, jostling, insulting, maybe stealing.

Set your goal as:
- Not only “I want to bathe,” but:
- “I want to bathe **and** keep my mind in a state conformable to nature.”

Then if you’re jostled or insulted:
- You can say: “I didn’t just want a wash; I also wanted to keep calm and reasonable. Getting upset would defeat my *real* goal.”

Lesson:
- Redefine your aim so that **your inner state** (which is up to you) is central,
- And the external part of the aim (the bath going smoothly) is secondary.

### Olympics Example
Wanting an Olympic victory:
- You must accept:
  - Strict diet, hard training, sacrifice, pain, risk of failure.
- If you want only the glory but not the work and risk:
  - Your desire is childish and unrealistic.

Epictetus’ point:
- Before desiring any external achievement:
  - Fully consider the **costs and risks** (many of which are not up to you),
  - And decide whether you actually want that entire package.
- Again, make your main goal:
  - To act nobly in training and competition (up to you),
  - Not just to win (not fully up to you).

## 5. Freedom of the Mind as True Freedom

### Who Is the True Slave? Who Is the True Master?

**True slave:**
- Anyone whose happiness depends on things controlled by others:
  - If you *must* have money, you are the slave of employers, markets, or patrons.
  - If you *must* be admired, you are the slave of public opinion.
  - If you *must* avoid death, you are the slave of anyone who can threaten you.
- Epictetus: “A person’s master is someone who has power over what he wants or does not want.”

**True master / free person:**
- Someone who:
  - Wants and avoids only what is up to them (their judgments, choices),
  - Is not emotionally hostage to anyone else’s actions.
- Such a person cannot be coerced:
  - Others can imprison or kill the body,
  - But cannot force the mind to approve or fear what it refuses to.

Thus:
- **True freedom** = independence of one’s mind and will from external control,  
  not political status or physical liberty.
- Even a literal slave can be inwardly free; a powerful ruler can be inwardly enslaved.

### Stoic “Invulnerability”
Epictetus promises a kind of **complete invulnerability**:
- If:
  - You care only about what is up to you,
  - You see externals as “nothing to you” in terms of your good and bad,
- Then:
  - No one can harm you in the only sense that truly matters (harm to your character and rational agency).

Illness, poverty, disgrace, even death:
- Are **events**, not harms,
- Unless you choose to see them as harms and react viciously.

### Is This Possible?
- As an *ideal*:  
  - Very demanding; requires deep training and sustained practice.
  - Most people, even Stoics in training, fall short.
- Psychologically:
  - Human beings seem wired for emotional attachment and vulnerability.
  - Total invulnerability may be unrealistic for most.

Epictetus’ stance:
- He knows that the “sage” is extremely rare.
- But he insists we should **aim** at this ideal, even if we never fully reach it.

### Is This Desirable?
**Advantages:**
- Enormous resilience and courage.
- Freedom from manipulation, anxiety, and bitterness.
- Ability to stay calm and just under great pressure.

**Concerns:**
- Might seem to flatten emotional life:
  - Less intense joy from externals,
  - Less grief at losses, including death of loved ones.
- Some argue that certain vulnerabilities (e.g., grief at a child’s death) are part of a fully human, loving life.

A moderate reading:
- We can value the Stoic emphasis on inner strength and non-attachment,
- While still thinking some emotional vulnerability is a valuable part of human relationships.

### Is the Stoic Approach Cruel or Uncaring Toward Others?

Worry:
- If you think no external harm really matters,
  - You might be indifferent to others’ suffering:
  - “They’re only harmed by their judgments—so why care?”

Epictetus’ reply:
- Most people are **not** Stoic sages:
  - They *are* still vulnerable to externals.
  - They *can’t help* being hurt by illness, poverty, injustice.
- So:
  - You must treat them gently and helpfully.
  - Sympathize outwardly with their grief (“moan with them verbally”)  
    while inwardly remembering that the real harm is in mistaken judgments.
- Also:
  - You yourself, as a non-sage in progress, are vulnerable; you should want a community that treats others well.

So Stoicism, properly applied:
- Does *not* recommend being cold or cruel.
- It asks you to:
  - Be emotionally disciplined inwardly,
  - But outwardly kind, patient, and supportive.

## 6. The Insufficiency of Purely Intellectual Work

Epictetus repeatedly criticizes:

- People who:
  - Study logic, psychology, and Stoic theory,
  - Can define “demonstration,” “truth,” “indifferent,” etc.,
  - Can explain Chrysippus,
- But **do not change** how they live.

His view:
- Philosophy’s **first and most necessary** part:
  - Training your *use of impressions*:
    - Not assenting to false or harmful judgments,
    - Not blaming others,
    - Not being ruled by passion and externals.
- Theoretical work (definitions, logical proofs) is:
  - Only **instrumental**,
  - Valuable *only* if it supports ethical transformation.

Signs of real progress (contrast with mere theory):
- You blame no one, praise no one excessively.
- When blocked, you blame yourself rather than externals.
- You greatly reduce desire and fear regarding externals.
- You care less about being seen as knowledgeable.

Exam takeaway:
- For Epictetus, **knowing the doctrine is not enough**;  
  genuine philosophy is a *way of life*, a constant practical discipline.

## 7. How to Love Your Family (Stoic Style)

Epictetus does **not** tell you not to love your family.  
He tells you how to love them **wisely**, without enslaving yourself.

### Key Ideas

1. **Remember they are mortal humans, not permanent possessions.**
   - When you kiss your child or spouse, remind yourself:
     - You are kissing a **human being**, which means mortal and fragile.
   - If they die, you will still be saddened as a human,
     - But you won’t be totally shattered if you have long practiced seeing them as on temporary loan from nature.

2. **“Never say ‘I have lost it’; say ‘I have given it back.’”**
   - Everything external—even your child, spouse, property—is **given by nature** temporarily.
   - When it is taken away, see it as:
     - Being returned, not stolen.
   - This reframing lessens despair and resentment.

3. **Banquet metaphor:**
   - Life is like a banquet:
     - When a dish comes to you, take some politely.
     - When it passes, do not grab or cling.
   - Apply this to:
     - Children, spouse, offices, wealth.
   - A Stoic:
     - Enjoys loved ones fully while present,
     - Does not clutch at them as if they must never leave.

4. **Voyage metaphor:**
   - You are on a ship anchored briefly:
     - You may step ashore, pick up a shellfish or vegetable,
     - But always keep an eye on the ship in case the captain calls you back.
   - Your family is like those temporary finds:
     - You care for them deeply,
     - But if “the captain” (death, fate) calls, you must be ready to go.

5. **How this shapes actual behavior:**
   - You:
     - Care for your family’s needs and wellbeing.
     - Fulfill your role as parent, child, spouse faithfully.
   - But you don’t:
     - Demand that they never die or never suffer,
     - Collapse entirely if they are taken from you,
     - Sacrifice virtue (lie, cheat, betray others) solely to protect or advantage them.

Stoic love:
- **Deep concern for their character and true good** (virtue),
- **Grateful enjoyment of their presence**,  
- Combined with **acceptance** that they are not fully yours and not under your control.

---

These are the core ideas and arguments you need from Epictetus on:

- The two-part recipe for living well, and why to reshape your desires,
- The “up to you / not up to you” distinction (with critique and salvageable core),
- Stoic management of unsatisfied desire (bath and Olympics examples),
- Freedom of mind, true slavery/mastery, and invulnerability (with worries and replies),
- The demand to go beyond mere intellectual theory,
- And the Stoic way to love your family without becoming enslaved to fortune.
