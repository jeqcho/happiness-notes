## Jeremy Bentham

### 1. Bentham’s Hedonism (What is the Good?)

**Core thesis (hedonism):**  
- Pleasure is the only intrinsic good.  
- Pain is the only intrinsic bad.  
- Everything else (money, health, friendship, knowledge, etc.) is good or bad only **instrumentally**, depending on how much pleasure or pain it produces.

**Quantitative view of pleasure:**
- All pleasures are the same kind of thing; they differ only in **amount**, not in kind.
- For Bentham, the key dimensions of a pleasure are:
  - **Intensity** – how strong the pleasure is.
  - **Duration** – how long it lasts.
- When deciding which pleasure is better, we look only at these quantitative features:
  - A more intense pleasure is better than a weaker one.
  - A longer-lasting pleasure is better than a shorter one.
- No pleasure is inherently “higher” or “lower” in quality; any pleasure can be outweighed by enough of another.

### 2. Bentham’s View of Human Motivation (What Actually Moves Us?)

**Psychological claim:**  
Humans are ruled by “two sovereign masters,” **pleasure and pain**.

- Every action we perform is ultimately motivated by:
  - The prospect of **obtaining pleasure**, or
  - The prospect of **avoiding pain**.
- This is meant as a **descriptive theory** (how people in fact behave), not yet a moral claim.
- On this picture, people are fundamentally **psychological hedonists**:
  - Even seemingly self-sacrificial actions are, on closer inspection, done because they bring the agent some expected pleasure (e.g., pride, satisfaction) or avoid some pain (e.g., guilt, social disapproval).

---

### 3. Bentham’s Moral Theory (How Ought We to Act?)

**Principle of Utility / Greatest Happiness Principle:**

- An action is **morally right** if and only if it **maximizes total happiness** (pleasure minus pain) for **everyone affected**.
- We should aim to produce:
  - “The **greatest happiness for the greatest number**.”
- Key features:
  - **Impartiality:** Each person’s pleasure and pain counts **equally**.
  - **Consequentialism:** Only the **results** (amount of pleasure/pain produced) matter for rightness, not motives or rules by themselves.
  - **Act utilitarianism:** For each possible act, we must ask which option produces the most overall happiness.

So Bentham accepts:
- A **hedonistic theory of value** (only pleasure is good).
- A **utilitarian theory of right action** (right acts maximize total pleasure).

### 4. The Tension in Bentham’s View

We now compare:

- **Psychological hedonism (motivation):**  
  People are **always** moved by what they think will bring **their own** pleasure or reduce **their own** pain.

- **Utilitarianism (morality):**  
  People **ought** to act so as to maximize **overall** happiness, giving **equal weight** to everyone’s pleasures and pains, not just their own.

**Nature of the tension:**

1. **Self-regarding motivation vs. impartial morality**
   - If we are in fact motivated only by our **own** expected pleasure/pain, morality’s demand to sacrifice our own happiness for others can look psychologically unrealistic.
   - Example:  
     - Morality may require me to donate a large part of my income to the poor.  
     - But if I am only ever motivated by my own pleasure, I will not choose that action when it significantly decreases my personal enjoyment.

2. **“Ought implies can” problem**
   - Many philosophers accept: if you **ought** to do something, then you **can** do it.
   - But if Bentham’s psychological theory says I **cannot** be motivated except by my own self-interested pleasure/pain, then:
     - How can I be morally obliged to act impartially for the **greatest happiness of all**, when this might significantly reduce my own happiness?
   - This creates a tension between:
     - The **descriptive** claim about what we can be motivated by, and
     - The **normative** claim about what we morally must do.

3. **Bentham’s possible move (not fully resolving the tension)**
   - He can say: legal punishment, social disapproval, and internal guilt are **pains**, and social praise and self-respect are **pleasures**.
   - These can align one’s **self-interest** with **general happiness**—acting for others may in fact bring the most pleasure to oneself.
   - But:
     - This depends on circumstances.  
     - It doesn’t fully remove the basic conceptual tension between a **self-focused psychology** and an **impartial moral standard**.

## John Stuart Mill

### 1. Agreement and Disagreement with Bentham

Mill broadly agrees with Bentham that:

- **Happiness** is **pleasure and the absence of pain**.
- **Morally right actions** are those that **promote the greatest happiness overall**.

So Mill accepts:

- A **hedonistic theory of value**, and
- A **utilitarian theory of morality**.

But he **disagrees strongly** with Bentham about the **nature of pleasure**.

Bentham:  
- All pleasures are the same in kind; differ only in **quantity** (intensity, duration).

Mill:  
- There are **qualitatively different kinds** of pleasure.
- Some pleasures are **“higher”** and more valuable than others, even when they have the same intensity and duration.

---

### 2. Mill’s Higher and Lower Pleasures

**Lower pleasures (“pleasures of the body”):**

- Largely **bodily or sensory**:
  - Eating, drinking, sex, physical comfort, rest, pleasant bodily sensations.
- Mill does **not** say these are bad or unimportant; they are genuine pleasures and part of a good life.
- But he thinks they are of a **lower quality**.

**Higher pleasures (“pleasures of the mind”):**

- Involve our **higher faculties**:
  - **Intellectual** activities: reading, learning, doing science or philosophy.
  - **Imaginative** activities: enjoying art, music, literature.
  - **Moral** and **emotional** pleasures: deep friendships, love, appreciation of beauty, acting from conscience and moral principle.
- These pleasures **use and exercise** capacities that distinguish humans from (most) non-human animals.

**Key claim:**

- **Higher pleasures are more valuable than lower pleasures as pleasures themselves**,  
  even when we **hold intensity and duration fixed**.
- So two pleasures with equal intensity and duration can differ in **quality**, and the higher one is **intrinsically better**.

This is Mill’s main disagreement with Bentham:  
- For Bentham, a very intense, long-lasting bodily pleasure could equal or surpass any other pleasure.  
- For Mill, no **amount** of lower pleasures can compensate for losing certain higher pleasures, according to those best placed to judge.

### 3. Mill’s Argument for the Superiority of Higher Pleasures

Mill’s argument can be set out in stages.

#### (a) Hedonistic starting point

- Mill accepts that **pleasure** and **freedom from pain** are the **only things desirable as ends**.
- But he claims we can still recognize **differences in quality** between pleasures, not just differences in quantity.

#### (b) How can we tell which pleasures are better “as pleasures”?

He proposes a **test**:

- Suppose there are two kinds of pleasure, A and B.
- Ask those who:
  - Have **experienced both** A and B, and
  - Are **competent judges**—that is, capable of appreciating and enjoying both kinds.
- If:
  - **All or almost all** such people **decisively prefer** A over B,
  - And this preference is made **independently of moral obligation** (i.e., they simply find A more desirable as an experience),
- Then we can say that:
  - Pleasure A is of **higher quality** and therefore **more valuable** as a pleasure.

#### (c) Mill’s empirical claim about actual preferences

Mill claims that, in fact:

- Those familiar with both higher and lower pleasures **strongly prefer** a life that exercises their **higher faculties**.
- They would:
  - Rather live as a **human being** with higher faculties, even if often dissatisfied,
  - Than as an unreflective creature who is fully content with only lower pleasures.
- Famous slogan:
  - “It is **better** to be a human being dissatisfied than a pig satisfied;  
    better to be Socrates dissatisfied than a fool satisfied.”
  - If the pig or fool disagrees, Mill says, that is because they only know their own side of the question.

He also insists that:

- Many people who appear to prioritize lower pleasures have actually:
  - **Lost the capacity** for higher pleasures, due to neglect or circumstances,
  - Not **calmly and knowingly** chosen lower over higher while still fully capable of both.

#### (d) Conclusion

From this, Mill concludes:

1. **Competent judges** almost uniformly prefer pleasures involving higher faculties.
2. This preference would remain even if higher pleasures brought more **discontent** or more vulnerability to suffering.
3. Therefore, higher pleasures have a **greater quality** and **worth** than lower ones, **as pleasures**.
4. So in evaluating actions, we should not just count **how much** pleasure they produce, but also **what kind** of pleasure.

This upgrades utilitarianism from a **purely quantitative** hedonism (Bentham) to a **qualitative** hedonism (Mill).

### 4. Objection to Mill’s Argument (from Lecture)

**Objection: Mill’s “competent judges” test may smuggle in non-hedonistic values and is empirically doubtful.**

The lecture raised concerns along these lines:

1. **Empirical worry: do people really prefer higher pleasures?**
   - Mill claims that almost all who know both kinds prefer higher pleasures.
   - But in real life, many educated people who fully know both:
     - Often choose “lower” pleasures (e.g., mindless entertainment, casual bodily enjoyments),
     - Even when they have access to and capacity for higher pleasures.
   - This suggests Mill’s empirical claim about the judgments of competent judges may be **false or overstated**.

2. **Motivation of the preference: is it really just about pleasure?**
   - Even when people do say they prefer higher activities (e.g., philosophy, art, moral action) to lower ones, their reasons often include:
     - Appeals to **dignity**, **self-respect**, **nobility**, or **moral worth**.
   - These seem to be values that are **not simply about the felt pleasantness** of the experience.
   - This leads to the charge that:
     - Mill is partly valuing the **nobility** or **dignity** of the activity itself, not just how pleasant it feels.
     - But then he is no longer a **pure hedonist**, since now something besides pleasure (e.g., dignity) is intrinsically valuable.

3. **Why this is a problem for Mill’s hedonism**
   - Mill wants to stay a **hedonist**: only pleasure is good as an end.
   - His defense of higher pleasures relies on the idea that competent judges find them **better “as pleasures”**.
   - But if their preference is driven by **non-hedonic considerations** (like dignity, moral ideals, or social evaluation), then:
     - The preference does not show that higher pleasures are **more pleasant**, only that they are valued on **other grounds**.
   - So the argument seems to:
     - Either undermine the purely hedonistic basis of utilitarianism, or
     - Fail to justify the claim that higher pleasures are **intrinsically** more valuable.

**Summary of the objection:**

- Mill’s appeal to “competent judges” and to a “sense of dignity” looks like an attempt to rank pleasures using standards **other than** sheer pleasantness.
- This threatens the coherence of his view:
  - He claims to be a **hedonist**, but his argument for higher pleasures seems to rely on **non-hedonistic values** and perhaps on **questionable empirical claims** about what informed people actually prefer.
