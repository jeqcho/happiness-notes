## 1. The Gift Perspective

### What is a “gift” for Kimmerer?

- A **gift** is something that:
  - Comes to you **through no action of your own**
  - Is **not earned**, not a reward, and not a payment
  - Is **freely given**
- Your proper role:  
  - To be **open-eyed and present**  
  - To **notice** the gift, **enjoy** it, and then respond appropriately

### World as a web of gifts

- The natural world is full of **“non-human people”** (plants, animals, waters, soils) who:
  - Provide what we need **without bargaining**: air, water, food, materials, beauty, knowledge
  - Thus, we live in a **world full of gifts**, not just neutral “resources”

## 2. From Gift → Gratitude → Reciprocity / Generosity

Kimmerer sees a natural **progression**:

1. **Receiving a gift**
   - Example: clean air, sunlight, fruits, a river, a forest
   - We did nothing to earn these; they are simply there, sustaining us

2. **Gratitude**
   - Recognition that what we receive is a **gift**, not an entitlement
   - Emotional response: **thankfulness, joy, wonder**
   - Cognitive shift: “I am being given to” rather than “I am owed this”

3. **Reciprocity / Generosity**
   - Genuine gratitude naturally asks: **“What can I give in return?”**
   - Leads to:
     - Caring for land and ecosystems
     - Sharing with others (human and non-human)
     - Acting to **support the flourishing** of the sources of our gifts
   - Important idea: **The value of a gift increases as it is shared and passed on.**

This chain is central: **enjoyment → gratitude → reciprocity** is how we should respond to the world’s gifts.

## 3. Your Existence as a Gift from Non-Human People

### Origin as a gift

- Your **very existence** depends on countless non-human beings:
  - Plants: convert sunlight into food; supply oxygen
  - Animals and microbes: form ecosystems; create soil; pollinate plants
  - Waters, air, earth: create habitable conditions for life
- You did **nothing** to deserve being born into a world that already:
  - Has breathable air, drinkable water, fertile soil, rich biodiversity  
  - Is **already prepared** to sustain you

### Continuation as a gift

- Your **continuing life** is also sustained by non-human people:
  - Daily gifts of: food, water, air, materials, medicines, beauty, meaning
  - Ecosystem processes (photosynthesis, water cycles, etc.) keep you alive
- Conclusion:  
  - **Both** the **origin** and **ongoing continuation** of your existence are **gifts** from non-human people.
  - This grounds a deep **debt of gratitude** and a duty of **reciprocity** toward them.

## 4. Gift Economy vs Market Economy

### Gift Economy (Kimmerer’s model)

- **Core idea**: Relationships are built on **giving, gratitude, and reciprocity**
- Key features:
  - Things are understood as **gifts**, not mere commodities
  - Gifts create **obligations of gratitude and care**
  - **Value increases** when shared and passed on
  - Emphasizes **mutual support, abundance, and relationship**
  - Rooted in **long-term connection** and responsibility

### Market Economy (contrast)

- **Core idea**: Relationships organized by **buying and selling**
- Key features:
  - Things are **commodities** with a **price tag**
  - Interactions are **transactions**, not relationships
  - **Value** is often tied to **scarcity**, profit, and individual gain
  - No built-in obligation of gratitude or reciprocity beyond the contract
  - Tends to encourage a **scarcity mindset** (“never enough,” competition)

### Why this contrast matters

- In a **gift economy**, we ask:  
  **“What can I give? How can I reciprocate?”**
- In a **market economy**, we tend to ask:  
  **“What can I get? What can I buy or sell?”**
- Kimmerer argues we should **inhabit the gift perspective** toward the Earth, even if we live within a market system.

## 5. Three Reasons to Adopt the Gift Perspective

Kimmerer gives (at least) **three reasons** to see the world as a gift:

1. **It is joyful**
   - Noticing gifts (beauty, air, food, relationships) increases **wonder and happiness**
   - Gratitude brings an immediate **emotional uplift**

2. **It fosters an abundance, not scarcity, mindset**
   - Market thinking often makes us feel there is **never enough**
   - Gift thinking highlights **how much we constantly receive**
   - Focus shifts from **hoarding** to **sharing** and **trust in mutual support**

3. **It might help humanity survive and flourish long-term**
   - A gift perspective encourages:
     - **Respect** for the sources of our gifts (ecosystems)
     - **Reciprocity**: protecting and restoring the natural world
   - This is crucial if humans are to **avoid destroying** the systems we depend on
   - Supports the possibility of **mutual flourishing** between humans and non-human people

---

## 6. Thesis of Mutual Flourishing

### What is mutual flourishing?

- **Core thesis**:  
  Human flourishing and the flourishing of non-human people **can and should go together**.
- Opposes the idea that:
  - Human well-being must come at the **expense** of nature
  - Nature must be sacrificed for human progress

### Key elements

- We are **interdependent**:
  - Our well-being depends on healthy ecosystems
  - Ecosystems can also benefit from respectful human actions (restoration, tending, seed dispersal, etc.)
- The goal is:
  - Not domination, but **relationship**
  - To create ways of living where:
    - Humans live well  
    - **And** the land, waters, plants, and animals also **thrive**

- Kimmerer sees humans as the **“little brother”** or **“new kid on the block”**:
  - Other species are our **older siblings** with long experience of living sustainably
  - We should **learn from them**, including the crucial lesson:
    - **Do not destroy the systems on which you depend.**

## 7. The Honorable Harvest

The **Honorable Harvest** is Kimmerer’s name for a set of **ethical guidelines** for taking from the Earth in a way that supports **mutual flourishing**.

Here are important features (know at least 3 clearly):

1. **Ask permission before taking**
   - Treat plants, animals, and ecosystems as **persons**, not objects
   - “Ask” by:
     - Observing health and abundance
     - Consulting cultural practices, knowledge, and your own conscience
   - If the answer (from signs of scarcity or harm) is “no,” **do not take**.

2. **Take only what you need**
   - Avoid greed and waste
   - Resist the tendency to accumulate just because you can
   - Emphasize **sufficiency**, not excess

3. **Take only from abundance; never take the first or the last**
   - Do not harvest in ways that risk wiping out a species or population
   - Leave enough so that the gift can **regenerate** and others can share it

4. **Use everything you take**
   - No disrespectful waste
   - Honors the life that has been given
   - Encourages careful, thoughtful taking

5. **Minimize harm**
   - Choose methods and times of taking that **least damage** the ecosystem
   - Consider long-term impacts of your actions

6. **Express gratitude**
   - Offer thanks in word, ceremony, or attentive care
   - Keeps the **gift perspective** alive in consciousness

7. **Share what you take**
   - Gifts are meant to **circulate**
   - Strengthens community and reflects the idea that **value increases when shared**

8. **Reciprocate; give back to the source**
   - Examples:
     - Restoring habitats
     - Planting, tending, cleaning, protecting
     - Supporting environmental stewardship
   - Embodies the move from **gratitude → reciprocity**

Any 3 of these, clearly explained, illustrate what the **Honorable Harvest** requires.

## 8. Two Guiding Questions for Relating to People (Human & Non-Human)

Kimmerer thinks we should relate to all people—human and non-human—through the **gift perspective** and the logic of **reciprocity**. Two key guiding questions:

1. **What gifts am I receiving from this person (human or non-human)?**
   - Focuses attention on:
     - Our **dependence** on others
     - The **value** of what we are given, often unnoticed
   - Encourages **gratitude** rather than entitlement

2. **Given these gifts, what can I give in return to support their flourishing?**
   - Moves from gratitude to **reciprocity and generosity**
   - Leads to asking:
     - How can I be a **good relative** to this being?
     - What actions of care, protection, or sharing are required of me?

These questions apply to:

- **Human people**: friends, family, communities, future generations
- **Non-human people**: plants, animals, waters, lands, ecosystems

They operationalize Kimmerer’s view that the **purpose of a human being** is:

- **To feel and express gratitude**
- **To love and care**—for human and non-human people alike.
