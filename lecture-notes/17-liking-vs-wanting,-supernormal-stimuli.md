## 1. Wanting vs Liking: Concepts and Their Divergence

### Core Definitions

- **Liking**
  - The *hedonic* aspect: how pleasant or enjoyable an experience feels.
  - Involves *pleasure*, *satisfaction*, “feels good right now.”
  - Can be measured (in animals) by facial expressions and hedonic reactions to rewards.

- **Wanting**
  - The *motivational* aspect: the urge, drive, or inclination to obtain or do something.
  - Involves *craving*, *goal-directed behavior*, “feels compelling to pursue.”
  - You can strongly want something you do not (or will not) actually enjoy.

### Logical and Empirical Independence

- **Conceptual point**: It is logically possible to:
  - Want without liking (e.g., an urge to smoke even when it no longer feels good).
  - Like without wanting (e.g., enjoying music that you don’t feel driven to seek out).
- **False beliefs problem**:
  - People often **misbelieve** what they enjoy:
    - Think they like doomscrolling / staying late at work / partying every night.
    - But report feeling drained, anxious, or empty afterwards.
  - So **motivation (wanting)** can be driven by habit, social pressure, or cues, not by actual enjoyment.

### Divergence from Well-Being and Values

- There are *two* important divergences:
  1. **Wanting vs Liking** (urge vs pleasure).
  2. **Wanting vs Long-Term Well-Being / Values**:
     - You can consistently want things that:
       - Make you less happy overall.
       - Undermine goals and values you care about (e.g., focus, relationships, integrity).
     - This connects to the idea that we may fail to “want what we *want* to want” (higher-order, reflective desires vs compulsive urges).

## 2. Neuroscience of Wanting vs Liking

### The “Wanting” System (Incentive Salience)

- Often called **incentive salience**:
  - Turns a cue or object into something that feels *attractive*, *attention-grabbing*, and *worth pursuing*.
- **Main brain circuitry** (simplified):
  - Ventral tegmental area (VTA) → nucleus accumbens (NAc) → prefrontal cortex, amygdala, and other limbic structures.
  - Dominantly uses **dopamine**.
- Key features:
  - Dopamine spikes when *cues* predict reward, not just when reward is consumed.
  - Sensitized by repeated drug use and certain behaviors (e.g., gambling), so cues trigger **stronger and stronger wanting** over time.

### The “Liking” System (Hedonic Hotspots)

- Involves **hedonic hotspots**: small areas where stimulation increases pleasure reactions.
- Key regions (in animals and humans):
  - Parts of the **nucleus accumbens shell**.
  - **Ventral pallidum**.
  - Related regions in orbitofrontal and insular cortex that encode how pleasant something feels.
- Neurochemistry:
  - **Opioid**, **endocannabinoid**, and **GABA** systems are especially important.
  - Manipulating these can increase or decrease the *pleasure* of a reward *without* changing how much it is pursued.

### Evidence They Are Distinct

- Animal studies:
  - Increasing dopamine → animals *work harder* for rewards (more wanting) but **do not show more pleasure** in facial expressions.
  - Stimulating opioid hotspots → **more hedonic facial reactions** to sweet tastes, even without big increases in effort to obtain them.
- Human evidence:
  - Patients with dopamine disruptions may lose motivation but still report normal enjoyment when something happens to them.
  - Addicted individuals often report intense **craving** (wanting) even when the substance is **no longer especially pleasurable** (liking reduced).

## 3. Addiction as Misalignment of Wanting and Liking

### How Addiction Develops (Neuroscience Perspective)

- **Repeated drug use** (or similar behaviors like gambling):
  - Sensitizes the **dopamine-related wanting system**.
  - Makes drug-related cues (paraphernalia, locations, people) highly salient and triggering.
- Over time:
  - **Wanting system**: becomes *hyper-reactive* (strong craving triggered by cues).
  - **Liking system**: often undergoes **tolerance**:
    - Same dose produces less pleasure.
    - May even produce mostly relief from withdrawal or only mild positive feeling.

### Phenomenology of Addiction

- **Strong craving without strong pleasure**:
  - People say things like:
    - “I don’t even enjoy it anymore; I just feel I need it.”
    - “I hate what this is doing to my life, but I can’t stop.”
- **Key misalignment**:
  - Wanting ≫ Liking.
  - Wanting also diverges from **long-term well-being** and the person’s own values.

### Examples Beyond Drugs

- **Gambling**:
  - Slot machines and online betting use **intermittent variable rewards**:
    - Unpredictable payoffs strongly activate dopamine-based wanting.
    - People often chase losses and feel compelled to keep playing, even when:
      - The experience is stressful and not particularly fun.
      - Financial and relational damage is obvious.
- **Junk food**:
  - Highly processed foods are engineered for strong **reward signals** (sugar–fat–salt combinations).
  - People may crave them intensely, but:
    - Report feeling sluggish, guilty, or physically unwell afterwards.
    - Long-term health (and often self-respect or body image) is harmed.

## 4. Supernormal Stimuli in Non-Human Animals

### Definition

- A **supernormal stimulus** is:
  - An *artificial or exaggerated* version of a natural stimulus.
  - It triggers **stronger responses** than the natural stimulus the animal evolved to respond to.
- Why it works:
  - Evolution tuned animals to respond to *simple cues* (e.g., bright color, size, sound).
  - When these cues are **amplified unnaturally**, the animal’s response system can be **hijacked**.

### Examples in Animals (At Least Three)

1. **Birds and Exaggerated Eggs**
   - Some birds prefer to sit on **larger, more brightly colored fake eggs**:
     - E.g., oversized, more speckled eggs can be more attractive than their own real eggs.
   - The cue “bigger and more patterned” activates parental instincts more strongly than the actual optimal egg.

2. **Male Insects (e.g., Jewel Beetles) and Bottles**
   - Male jewel beetles have been observed trying to mate with **brown, dimpled beer bottles**:
     - The bottles exaggerate features of the female’s shell (color, texture).
   - The bottle becomes more sexually attractive than real females: a classic supernormal stimulus.

3. **Sticklebach Fish and Red Bellies**
   - Male sticklebacks attack rivals that show a **red belly**.
   - They will respond *more ferociously* to **artificial models** with exaggeratedly bright red than to real males.
   - The color cue alone—when amplified—evokes maximal aggression.

4. **Cuckoo Chicks’ Gaping Mouths (Another Example)**
   - Parasitic cuckoo chicks have **oversized, very brightly colored gapes**.
   - Host parents feed them **more frequently** than they would feed their own chicks.
   - The exaggerated “feed me” signal functions as a supernormal stimulus for parental feeding behavior.

### Do Supernormal Stimuli Create Wanting/Liking Divergences in Animals?

- Animals are typically **driven by evolved “wanting” systems**:
  - They will *work harder* or devote more care to the supernormal stimulus (e.g., giant egg).
- We have limited evidence about their **subjective pleasure** (liking).
- But from a functional point of view:
  - The response is **maladaptive**: they invest effort in artificial objects that do not improve fitness.
  - There is at least a **divergence between motivation and long-term biological “good”** (survival/reproduction).

## 5. Possible Supernormal Stimuli in Humans

Human technologies often **amplify evolved cues** (sweetness, novelty, social approval, sexual signals), producing supernormal stimuli for our brains.

### 5.1 Processed Junk Food

- **Why it’s supernormal**:
  - Our ancestors encountered **scarce, natural** sources of sugar and fat.
  - Modern engineered foods combine:
    - Very high sugar.
    - High fat.
    - Exact textures and flavors tuned to maximize palatability.
  - This exaggerates the cues “high energy, safe food” that our reward systems track.
- **Neural impact**:
  - Strong activation of **dopamine-based wanting** and **hedonic hotspots** (especially at first).
  - Over time:
    - Tolerance can reduce liking.
    - Cues (brands, smells, packaging) still trigger strong wanting.
- **Wanting vs Liking?**
  - Many people:
    - Crave certain snacks even when they say they don’t really *enjoy* them anymore; it’s just a habit or quick fix.
    - Keep eating past the point of enjoyment.
  - Clear **risk of wanting > liking**.
- **Long-term well-being / value conflict**:
  - Health costs: obesity, diabetes, heart disease.
  - Psychological costs: guilt, low self-esteem, feeling out of control.
  - People often *reflectively* value:
    - Health, energy, self-control, longevity.
  - But **momentary wanting** drives behavior in ways that undermine these values.

### 5.2 Social Media and the Attention Economy

- **Why it’s supernormal**:
  - Our brains evolved for:
    - Occasional social feedback and gossip in small groups.
    - Infrequent, meaningful signals of status and acceptance.
  - Social media platforms provide:
    - Continuous **likes, comments, notifications**, “stories,” infinite scroll.
    - Constant novelty and emotional salience (outrage, fear, admiration).
  - These are *amplified social and informational cues* → a supernormal stimulus for attention and social validation.

- **Persuasive design features** (examples):
  - **Notification badges** (often red):
    - Grab attention; signal urgency; feel like a to-do list that must be cleared.
  - **Intermittent variable rewards**:
    - You don’t know when you’ll see a particularly interesting post or get a like.
    - This unpredictability is extremely effective at driving repeated checking.
  - **Endless feeds**:
    - No natural stopping point; you can always scroll more, so wanting is never allowed to “complete.”

- **Neural impact**:
  - Each check can deliver:
    - Small dopamine hits from novelty and perceived social approval.
  - Over time:
    - Cues (phone buzz, boredom, emotional discomfort) automatically trigger the urge to check.
    - This urge can become habitual, even **compulsive**.

- **Wanting vs Liking?**
  - Many report:
    - Repeatedly checking apps even when the experience feels **anxious, draining, or empty**.
    - Feeling worse after long sessions (jealousy, outrage, fatigue).
  - Yet they **can’t easily resist the urge** to check again.
  - Strong evidence of:
    - **Wanting (urge to check, scroll, refresh)** > **Liking (actual enjoyment)**.

- **Long-term well-being / value conflict**:
  - Short-term:
    - Distraction from tasks they care about.
    - Elevated stress and anxiety from constant outrage-driven news and comparison.
  - Long-term:
    - Time fragmentation and loss of deep focus; harder to think clearly or creatively.
    - Undermines **self-regulation and reflection**, making it harder to:
      - Decide what kind of life you want.
      - “Want what you want to want” in a stable, reflective way.
  - Even if people value:
    - Attention to real relationships, meaningful work, and civic engagement,
    - Their daily behavior can be dominated by **algorithmically shaped micro-urges** instead.

### 5.3 Gambling and “Gamified” Digital Rewards

- **Why it’s supernormal**:
  - Humans evolved to respond strongly to **rare, uncertain rewards** (e.g., hunting success).
  - Modern gambling:
    - Perfectly engineers **unpredictable payoff schedules** (slot machines, online betting).
    - Adds lights, sounds, near-miss experiences, and easy electronic payment.
  - Many games and apps copy these mechanisms:
    - **Loot boxes**, daily rewards, streaks in games or apps.

- **Neural impact**:
  - **Intermittent variable reward schedules** are known to:
    - Produce especially strong and persistent **dopamine-driven wanting**.
    - Make behavior resistant to extinction (hard to stop even when no longer fun or when losing).
- **Wanting vs Liking?**
  - Gamblers often:
    - Continue playing after enjoyment has faded, driven by compulsion and hope to “get even.”
    - Report that wins produce less and less thrill, but the urge to chase remains.
  - Many gamers:
    - Keep logging in to maintain streaks or get loot, even when the game no longer feels intrinsically fun.
- **Long-term well-being / value conflict**:
  - Financial harm, relationship strain, time loss.
  - Guilt and shame; feeling one’s life is not under one’s own control.
  - Conflict with values like responsibility, honesty, care for family, meaningful use of time.

---

### 5.4 Pornography and Hyper-Stimulating Sexual Content (Optional Example)

- **Why it’s supernormal**:
  - Human sexual systems evolved for:
    - Real partners in limited social environments.
  - Online pornography:
    - Offers infinite novelty (many different partners, acts, and intensities).
    - Highly visual, curated, and exaggerated: idealized bodies, simplified scripts.
  - This greatly amplifies sexual cues beyond what was ancestrally typical.

- **Neural impact**:
  - Strong activation of reward circuits with repeated use, especially with novelty chasing.
- **Wanting vs Liking?**
  - Some report:
    - Habitual or compulsive use that persists even when they feel numb or dissatisfied.
    - Escalation to more extreme content to get the same arousal (tolerance).
  - Again, **craving** can persist or strengthen while **enjoyment** either stagnates or declines.
- **Long-term well-being / value conflict**:
  - Impact on relationships, sexual functioning, and expectations.
  - Conflict with personal moral or religious values.
  - Time and attention diverted from deeper intimacy and other life projects.

## 6. Supernormal Stimuli, Wanting vs Liking, and Diminished Well-Being

### General Patterns

1. **Supernormal stimuli exaggerate key cues**:
   - Food: sweetness, fat, calorie density.
   - Social media: social approval, novelty, emotional intensity.
   - Gambling/gamified systems: unpredictable rewards and near-misses.
   - Sexual content: exaggerated attractiveness and variety.
2. **They disproportionately activate the “wanting” system**:
   - Dopamine-based circuits respond strongly to:
     - Novelty.
     - Unpredictable rewards.
     - Intense sensory and social cues.
3. **Over time, liking often fails to keep up**:
   - Tolerance or numbness (need more for same pleasure).
   - Boredom, guilt, or emptiness.
   - Yet cues still trigger powerful urges.

### Are These Cases of Wanting Without Liking?

- Often they are at least:
  - **Partial** divergences:
    - People may still like them somewhat, but not nearly as much as they *want* them.
  - In some cases:
    - Strong urges persist even when self-reported pleasure is minimal or negative (classic addiction-like pattern).

### Impact on Long-Term Well-Being and Values

- **Short-term vs long-term**:
  - Short-term: tiny, frequent hits of shallow reward.
  - Long-term: reduced ability to:
    - Focus attention.
    - Engage in deep, meaningful activities.
    - Maintain health, relationships, finances.
- **Conflict with values**:
  - Many people **reflectively value**:
    - Meaningful work, genuine relationships, civic responsibility, creativity.
  - Supernormal stimuli can:
    - “Eat up” the attention and energy needed for these.
    - Make it harder to even *form* or *sustain* higher-order values due to constant distraction.
- This links the neuroscience with ethics and the philosophy of happiness:
  - The **structure of our brains** makes us vulnerable to:
    - **Wanting** things that:
      - We don’t truly like.
      - Do not help us live the lives we most deeply want.
  - Recognizing this gap is crucial for:
    - Personal self-regulation.
    - Evaluating technologies and environments that deliberately exploit these vulnerabilities.

### Summary for Exam

- **Wanting vs Liking**:
  - Distinct concepts and neural systems (dopamine vs hedonic hotspots).
  - Can and often do diverge in humans.
- **Addiction**:
  - Prototype case of wanting ≫ liking.
  - Driven by sensitized wanting systems and tolerance in liking.
- **Supernormal stimuli (animals)**:
  - Exaggerated artificial stimuli (giant eggs, beer-bottle “mates,” bright red fish models, cuckoo gapes) trigger stronger-than-normal instinctive responses.
- **Supernormal stimuli (humans)**:
  - Processed foods, social media, gambling/gamified rewards, and (arguably) pornography.
  - They often create:
    - Strong urges to indulge.
    - Outcomes that reduce long-term well-being and conflict with our deeper values.
  - They are prime candidates for **divergences between wanting, liking, and living well**.
