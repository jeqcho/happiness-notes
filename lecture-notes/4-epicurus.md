## Epicureanism – Exam-Focused Notes

---

## 1. The Three Theses of the Epicureans

Epicureanism is built on three core theses:

### 1.1 Physicalism
- **Claim:** Everything that exists is physical (made of atoms and void).
- The **soul/mind** is also made of fine atoms.
- **Implication for happiness and death:**
  - No non-physical, immortal soul.
  - When the body dies, the soul’s atoms disperse → no consciousness after death.
  - This supports the claim that **death is nothing to us**, because there is no subject left to feel anything.

### 1.2 Atheism (in Epicurean sense)
- Epicurus does not deny the existence of gods, but:
  - Gods are **perfectly blissful and indestructible**.
  - They **do not intervene** in the world, do not reward/punish, and do not care about human affairs.
- From a practical perspective:
  - We must **not fear gods** (no divine punishment, no afterlife judgment).
  - Religion-based fears (hell, eternal punishment, angry gods) are baseless.
- This removes a major source of **mental disturbance**, contributing to ataraxia.

### 1.3 Hedonism
- **Claim:** Pleasure is the only intrinsic good; pain is the only intrinsic bad.
- All rational choices aim (or should aim) at:
  - **Maximizing pleasure**, and
  - **Minimizing pain**.
- But Epicurus has a **refined** view of pleasure:
  - The highest pleasure is **not constant stimulation**, but **freedom from bodily pain and mental disturbance**.

## 2. How Best to Pursue Pleasure and the Absence of Pain

### 2.1 Pleasure as the Goal: Ataraxia and Aponia
- **Goal of life:** a state of:
  - **Aponia** – absence of bodily pain.
  - **Ataraxia** – calm, tranquil, deeply peaceful mind (absence of fear, anxiety, disturbance).
- Once you lack pain in body and disturbance in mind:
  - You have reached the **limit of pleasure**; you do not need “more” pleasure.
  - Extra luxuries do not make you more happy in any deep sense.

### 2.2 Types of Desires and Basic Needs

Epicurus classifies desires:

1. **Natural and Necessary Desires**
   - For:
     - Basic bodily survival (food, water, shelter).
     - Freedom from bodily pain.
     - Mental health and peace (freedom from fear, especially fear of gods and death).
   - They are:
     - **Easy to satisfy**, and
     - **Necessary** for happiness.
   - Example: simple food and drink to remove hunger and thirst.

2. **Natural but Unnecessary Desires**
   - Have a natural basis, but are not required for happiness.
   - Example: desire for fancy foods instead of simple, nourishing foods.
   - Can be enjoyed, but pursuing them intensely creates dependency and risk.

3. **Groundless (Vain) Desires**
   - Not rooted in natural needs.
   - Typically for **fame, power, great wealth, status, luxury**.
   - **Hard to satisfy**, and even if satisfied, they:
     - Generate anxiety (fear of losing them).
     - Do not secure ataraxia.

**Key strategy:**  
- Focus on **natural and necessary** desires.
- Limit or ignore **groundless** desires; they produce more disturbance than pleasure.

### 2.3 Practical Guidance for Pursuing Pleasure

- **Self-sufficiency:**  
  - Learn to be content with little.
  - Simple lifestyle → easier to secure basic needs → less anxiety about losing things.

- **Simple pleasures:**
  - Plain food, clean water, basic shelter, modest clothing.
  - Once pain from want is removed, such simple goods can be as pleasurable as luxuries.

- **Prudence (practical wisdom):**
  - Central Epicurean virtue.
  - Use careful reasoning to:
    - Choose pleasures that lead to long-term pleasure and minimal pain.
    - Sometimes **endure short-term pain** for greater long-term pleasure.
    - Sometimes **reject short-term pleasure** if it leads to greater long-term pain.

- **“Not the life of the profligate”:**
  - Epicurus explicitly rejects a life of constant partying, luxury, and excess.
  - Real happiness comes from:
    - A stable, undisturbed mind.
    - Freedom from fear.
    - Modest, secure satisfaction of basic needs.

### 2.4 Is It Really Easy to Satisfy Basic Needs?

- In theory:
  - Basic needs of body and mind are **few** and **easy to satisfy**.
- In practice:
  - How easy this is **depends on society and circumstances**:
    - Economic conditions.
    - Political stability.
    - Social safety nets, etc.
  - Still, the Epicurean point: compared to chasing luxury and status, focusing on basics is **much more realistic and secure**, even in harder societies.

## 3. Why Not Pursue Fame, Power, and Wealth?

Epicurus strongly advises **against** making these your life goals.

### 3.1 Main Reasons

1. **The process is stressful and painful.**
   - To get fame, power, or great wealth, you often must:
     - Work excessively.
     - Compete harshly.
     - Engage in flattery, politics, or morally dubious behavior.
   - This creates **ongoing stress** and mental disturbance.

2. **You probably won’t get them – and if you do, you’ll fear losing them.**
   - They are:
     - Rare.
     - Dependent on others’ opinions and external circumstances.
   - If you fail: frustration, envy, anxiety.
   - If you succeed: constant **fear of loss**, jealousy from others, threats to your position.
   - Overall: unstable basis for happiness.

3. **They spoil you.**
   - Luxuries and status can:
     - Raise your “baseline” expectations.
     - Make simple pleasures seem dull.
   - You become **less resilient** and more dependent on rare conditions for happiness.

### 3.2 Connection to Desires and Pleasure

- Fame, power, wealth are examples of **groundless desires**:
  - Hard to achieve.
  - Harder to keep.
  - Bring more anxiety than secure pleasure.
- Pursuing them works **against** ataraxia:
  - Increases fear of failure, fear of others, and fear of loss.
- By contrast, satisfying **basic bodily and mental needs**, plus cultivating friendships, gives **stable, long-term** pleasure.

### 3.3 Dependence on Culture

- In a culture obsessed with status and wealth:
  - Social pressure to chase these is strong.
  - Resisting this pressure is harder.
- Still, the Epicurean claim is universal:
  - **Whatever culture you live in**, real stability comes from:
    - Modest needs.
    - Tranquil mind.
    - Good friendships.
  - Culture may change **how hard** this is, but not **what** leads to happiness.

## 4. Friendship Is Golden

Epicurus places **enormous value** on friendship.

### 4.1 Why Friendship Matters So Much

- Friends provide:
  - **Emotional support**: comfort in distress, sharing joys.
  - **Security**: mutual assistance in times of need (illness, poverty, danger).
  - **Trust and understanding**: feeling known and cared for.
- These contribute directly to:
  - **Ataraxia**: calm mind, reduced fear, sense of safety.
  - **Stability**: more reliable than money or status.

### 4.2 Friendship vs Material Wealth

- Material riches can be:
  - Lost suddenly (accidents, theft, economic changes).
  - A source of envy and danger (people may try to take them).
- Close friendships:
  - Are **less vulnerable** than wealth to external forces (if well-chosen).
  - Create a **network of mutual support** that often outlasts and outperforms material safety nets.
- Hence Epicurean advice:
  - **Don’t waste your life** chasing fame, power, wealth.
  - Invest your time and energy in building and maintaining **close, supportive friendships**.

### 4.3 Role of Culture

- In some cultures:
  - Individualism and competition can weaken social bonds.
  - People move frequently or work long hours → harder to maintain deep friendships.
- This makes the Epicurean strategy **harder**, but:
  - Even then, friendship remains one of the **most reliable sources** of security and pleasure.
  - You may need to **consciously resist** cultural pressures to prioritize work/status over relationships.

## 5. “Death Is Nothing to Us”

Central Epicurean claim: **Death is nothing to us.**

### 5.1 Core Argument

Epicurus relies on two key ideas:

1. **All good and bad consist in sense-experience.**
   - Pleasure and pain are felt states.
   - To be harmed or benefitted, you must be capable of **experiencing** something.

2. **Death is the complete absence of sense-experience.**
   - Because of physicalism:
     - When the body dies, the soul’s atoms disperse.
     - No consciousness, no awareness, no sensation.

**Argument structure:**

- While we exist, we can experience things, but **death is not yet present**.
- When death is present (we are dead), **we do not exist** to experience anything.
- So there is **never** a time when both:
  - We exist as subjects of experience, and
  - Death is affecting us.
- Therefore:
  - Death does not affect us at any time.
  - So death is **nothing to us** – it cannot be good or bad for us.

### 5.2 Fear of Death as a Source of Disturbance

- People often:
  - Fear death as the greatest evil.
  - Suffer anxiety just thinking about their future death.
- Epicurus thinks this is irrational:
  - To fear something **only in anticipation**, when you know that when it happens you won’t feel anything, is to cause yourself **unnecessary present pain**.
- Correct understanding of death:
  - Removes the **fear of non-existence**.
  - Makes the **finitude** of life acceptable.
  - Helps secure **ataraxia**.

### 5.3 Objection: “But I’ll Miss Out!”

**Objection:**  
Even if I won’t feel pain when dead, death is bad because it deprives me of future pleasures I could have had.

**Epicurean replies (exam-relevant points):**

1. **No subject after death:**
   - For something to be bad *for you*, there must be a *you* for whom it is bad.
   - After death, there is no you at all, so no one who is “missing out.”

2. **Asymmetry with prenatal non-existence:**
   - We do not regard the long time before we were born as a terrible deprivation.
   - Our non-existence after death is similar.
   - If we do not lament the infinite past when we did not exist, we should not obsess over future non-existence.

3. **Focus on present life, not infinite extension:**
   - A good life is about **quality** (pleasantness) not **quantity** (length).
   - The wise person focuses on making life **pleasant now**, not on extending it indefinitely.
   - Removing the craving for immortality reduces anxiety and dissatisfaction.

### 5.4 The Four-Part Cure (Tetrapharmakos)

Epicurus’ “four-part cure” summarizes how to achieve ataraxia:

1. **Don’t fear god.**
   - Gods (if they exist) are blissful and indifferent, not punishing.

2. **Don’t worry about death.**
   - Death is nothing to us: when we exist, it is not; when it is, we are not.

3. **What is good is easy to get.**
   - Basic bodily and mental needs are few and easy to satisfy.

4. **What is terrible is easy to endure.**
   - Intense pains are usually short.
   - Long-lasting pains are often moderate and manageable.
   - With a proper mindset and simple needs, life’s bad things are not overwhelmingly horrible.

These points:
- Remove fear of gods and death.
- Show that happiness is **accessible** (basic needs) and suffering is **limited**.
- Together, they aim to secure **a calm, untroubled life**.

## 6. Key Takeaways for the Exam

- **Three theses:**
  - Physicalism: everything, including soul, is material; no afterlife consciousness.
  - Atheism (practically): no divine punishment or reward; don’t fear gods.
  - Hedonism: pleasure is the only intrinsic good; the highest form = absence of pain/disturbance.

- **Best way to pursue pleasure:**
  - Satisfy **natural and necessary** desires → bodily health, freedom from pain, mental tranquility.
  - Avoid groundless desires (fame, power, wealth, luxuries).
  - Aim for **ataraxia** and **aponia**, not constant stimulation.
  - Use prudence to weigh short-term vs long-term pleasures and pains.

- **Role of friendship:**
  - More secure and valuable than wealth or fame.
  - Key source of long-term safety, support, and pleasure.
  - Central to an Epicurean happy life.

- **Death is nothing:**
  - All good/bad requires sensation.
  - Death = end of sensation.
  - So death cannot harm you; fearing it is irrational.
  - Objection (“I’ll miss out”) fails because there is no subject after death to be deprived.
