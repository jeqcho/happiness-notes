# Epicurus (Epicureanism) – Exam Notes

---

## 1. Three Theses of the Epicureans

### 1.1 Physicalism
- **Claim**: Everything that exists is physical (bodies and void).
- Human soul/mind is made of fine atoms and **dies with the body**.
- **No immortal soul, no afterlife**, no consciousness after death.
- Importance:
  - Removes fear of post‑mortem punishment or reward.
  - Supports the idea that **death is the end of experience**, so cannot be a felt harm.

### 1.2 Atheism (in the Epicurean sense)
- Epicurus rejects **traditional religious views** of gods as:
  - World‑rulers,
  - Rewarding the virtuous,
  - Punishing the wicked,
  - Interfering in human affairs.
- If gods exist at all, they are **perfectly blessed and unconcerned** with us.
- So:
  - **No need to fear gods**.
  - Religious fear of divine punishment is a major source of mental disturbance; Epicurus aims to eliminate it.

### 1.3 Hedonism
- **Only pleasure is intrinsically good**, and only pain is intrinsically bad.
- But “pleasure” is understood in a specific way:
  - Not constant partying, luxury, or intense stimulation.
  - The **highest pleasure** = **absence of bodily pain** and **absence of mental disturbance**.
    - Bodily: no illness, hunger, extreme discomfort (aponia).
    - Mental: no fear, anxiety, or turmoil (ataraxia).
- We should:
  - Choose actions by **calculating** overall pleasure vs pain.
  - Sometimes **endure a pain** now for greater pleasure later.
  - Sometimes **forgo a pleasure** now to avoid greater pain later.

## 2. How Best to Pursue Pleasure and the Absence of Pain

### 2.1 The Goal: Ataraxia and Aponia
- **Ataraxia**: calm, tranquil, deeply peaceful state of mind.
- **Aponia**: absence of bodily pain.
- Living well = achieving and maintaining this stable condition, not chasing highs.

### 2.2 Basic Strategy: Satisfy Basic Needs, Not Luxuries
Epicurus divides desires:

1. **Natural and Necessary Desires**
   - Needed for:
     - Life itself (food, water, shelter).
     - Freedom from bodily distress (basic health).
     - Happiness (friendship, security, freedom from fear).
   - Features:
     - **Few and simple**.
     - **Easy to satisfy** (in principle).
     - Once met, they bring lasting contentment and remove pain.
   - Examples: simple food and drink, safe shelter, close friends, peace of mind.

2. **Natural but Not Necessary Desires**
   - Have a natural basis but are not required for happiness or survival.
   - Examples: fancy foods, sexual variety, comfort upgrades.
   - They add **extra** pleasure but can increase dependence and vulnerability.
   - Should be treated as **optional bonuses**, not as needs.

3. **Vain or Groundless Desires**
   - Have **no natural limit**; often socially constructed.
   - Examples: unlimited wealth, fame, high status, luxury lifestyles, immortality.
   - Hard or impossible to fully satisfy; typically create **anxiety and dissatisfaction**.
   - Epicurus: these are **harmful** and should be **eliminated** as far as possible.

**Key recommendation**:  
Concentrate on **natural and necessary desires**; be cautious about natural‑but‑not‑necessary; reject vain desires.

### 2.3 Why Simple Living Promotes Pleasure
- **Self‑sufficiency**: If you can be content with little, you are:
  - Less dependent on luck and social approval.
  - Less vulnerable to loss.
- Simple, modest living:
  - Keeps the body healthy.
  - Makes one more resilient in hard times.
  - Lets you enjoy occasional luxuries **more** when they happen.
- Epicurus insists hedonism is **not** about constant luxury but about **removing pain and disturbance**.

### 2.4 Is It Really Easy to Meet Basic Needs?
- Epicurus claims basic bodily and mental needs are:
  - Few,
  - Simple,
  - Easy to meet.
- Potential criticism (important to note):
  - How easy it is to secure food, shelter, safety, and friendship **depends on your society**:
    - In unjust or impoverished conditions, meeting basic needs may be very hard.
  - This raises questions about how realistic Epicurean advice is in oppressive or unequal contexts.

## 3. Why Not Pursue Fame, Power, and Wealth?

Epicurus explicitly advises: **do not organize your life around fame, political power, or great wealth.**

### 3.1 Reasons Against Pursuing These Goals

1. **The pursuit itself is stressful**
   - Climbing social or political hierarchies demands:
     - Flattery, competition, deception, constant vigilance.
   - This creates ongoing **anxiety and conflict**, undermining ataraxia.

2. **Low chance of success, and fear if you succeed**
   - Most people **won’t achieve** great fame, power, or wealth → frustration and disappointment.
   - If you do succeed:
     - You become anxious about **losing** what you gained.
     - You must constantly defend and maintain your position.
   - Result: mental disturbance, fear, and instability.

3. **You get “spoiled”**
   - Becoming used to luxury and status raises your “baseline”:
     - Ordinary experiences no longer satisfy you.
     - You need ever more to feel the same level of pleasure.
   - This makes you **less self‑sufficient**, more fragile, and easier to disturb.

### 3.2 Connection to Hedonism
- Epicurus is not anti‑pleasure; he thinks **fame, power, wealth**:
  - **Do not reliably increase net pleasure**.
  - Typically introduce more **anxiety, fear, and disturbance** than they are worth.
- True Epicurean calculation:
  - Ask: “Will this pursuit, overall, reduce pain and disturbance?”
  - For fame/power/wealth, Epicurus answers: **No**.

## 4. The Role of Friendship in Epicureanism

### 4.1 Why “Friendship is Golden”
Epicurus sees friendship as **one of the greatest sources of stable pleasure**.

Main benefits:

1. **Security and support**
   - Friends provide:
     - Material help in need (food, shelter, care).
     - Protection in a dangerous world.
   - This reduces **fear about the future** (a major mental disturbance).

2. **Emotional well‑being**
   - Companionship, affection, mutual concern → ongoing mild pleasures.
   - Shared joy and reduced suffering:
     - Happiness is enhanced when shared.
     - Burdens are lighter when others help carry them.

3. **Philosophical and moral support**
   - Like‑minded friends help each other:
     - Maintain Epicurean attitudes (e.g., not fearing death, not chasing vain desires).
     - Practise prudence and virtue.
   - This stabilizes ataraxia over time.

### 4.2 Friendship vs Material Wealth
- Epicurus: **friends offer more real security than wealth**.
  - Wealth can be stolen, lost, taxed.
  - True friends are more reliable in crisis and maintain your mental peace.
- Instead of chasing public recognition and riches, Epicurus advises:
  - **Invest your time and energy in close, supportive friendships.**

### 4.3 Cultural Dependence
- How well friendship can provide security depends partly on:
  - Social structures and norms (e.g., legal systems, safety nets, persecution).
- In some cultures:
  - Tight‑knit communities may make Epicurean friendship especially effective.
- In harsher contexts:
  - Friendships may be more fragile under external pressure.
- The **core idea**: whatever the culture, strong friendships are a **central, relatively reliable route** to long‑term pleasure and security.

## 5. Epicurus’ Argument that “Death is Nothing to Us”

### 5.1 Core Argument

Epicurus’s key claims:

1. **All good and bad consist in pleasure and pain.**
   - Something is bad for you only if it involves, or leads to, your **suffering** (physical or mental).
   - Something is good for you only if it involves pleasure or removes pain.

2. **Pleasure and pain require sense‑experience.**
   - You feel pleasure and pain only while you are conscious.
   - No awareness → no pleasure, no pain.

3. **Death is the complete absence of sense‑experience.**
   - At death, the soul/mental atoms disperse.
   - There is **no subject** left to feel anything.
   - Therefore, there is no pleasure and no pain after death.

4. **Therefore, death is nothing to us.**
   - “When we exist, death is not present; when death is present, we do not exist.”
   - There is **never a time** when both you and your state of being dead coexist.
   - So death cannot be experienced as a harm by you.

Conclusion:  
We should **not fear being dead**, because being dead is not an experience and thus cannot be bad for us.

### 5.2 The “You’ll Miss Out” Objection

**Objection**: Even if you don’t feel anything when dead, death is bad because:
- It **deprives** you of future pleasures you could have had.

Epicurean reply:

1. Harm requires a subject.
   - To be harmed, you must **exist** at the time you are harmed.
   - After death, there is no “you” to be deprived.
   - So deprivation by death cannot be bad **for you**.

2. Anticipatory fear is irrational.
   - People suffer now from fear of a future state (non‑existence) that:
     - Will never be experienced.
   - Epicurus: This is **unnecessary mental pain** based on confusion.
   - Once you grasp that death is nothing, the fear dissolves, making life more pleasant.

3. Focus on quality, not length, of life.
   - The wise person:
     - Does not cling to life at any cost or fear non‑existence.
     - Seeks **the most pleasant life**, not the longest.
   - Once you have lived pleasantly (with ataraxia), there is **no rational need** to crave more and more time.

### 5.3 The Four‑Part Cure (Tetrapharmakos)

Epicurus offers a “four‑part cure” for human anxiety. It targets the main sources of mental disturbance:

1. **Don’t fear the gods.**
   - Gods, if they exist, are blissful and non‑interfering.
   - No divine punishment or reward to fear → reduces religious anxiety.

2. **Don’t fear death.**
   - Death is the end of sensation.
   - No possible experience of pain after death.
   - Understanding this removes the **fear of being dead** and much of the fear of dying.

3. **What is good is easy to obtain.**
   - True goods are:
     - Basic bodily needs (simple food, water, shelter).
     - Basic mental needs (friendship, freedom from fear).
   - These are **few and simple**, at least in principle, so a happy life is within reach.

4. **What is bad is easy to endure.**
   - Intense pains tend to be short; long‑lasting pains are often mild enough to be bearable.
   - With the right mindset, most suffering can be tolerated without destroying happiness.

Connection to death:
- Parts (1) and (2) directly remove fear of supernatural punishment and non‑existence.
- Parts (3) and (4) reassure us about life’s hardships, making our **finite** life sufficient and acceptable.
- Altogether, the Four‑Part Cure aims to secure **ataraxia**, showing why death and the finiteness of life are **not threats** to happiness.

**Summary for Exam**  
- **Three theses**: Physicalism (no immortal soul), Atheism (no interventionist gods), Hedonism (pleasure = good, pain = bad; highest pleasure = absence of pain/disturbance).  
- **Best pursuit of pleasure**: Satisfy **natural and necessary desires**; simple life; avoid vain desires (fame, wealth, power) which create stress and anxiety.  
- **Friendship**: Central to security and stable pleasure; superior to wealth; crucial for long‑term ataraxia.  
- **Death is nothing**: No sensation after death → no pain → no harm; fear of death is based on confusion; Four‑Part Cure removes fears (gods, death, poverty, suffering) and secures tranquility.
