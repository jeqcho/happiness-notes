# Epicureanism – Exam Notes

---

## 1. Three Theses of the Epicureans

### 1.1 Physicalism

- **Claim**: Everything that exists is physical (bodies and void); no immaterial souls or supernatural forces acting in the world.
- **Human beings**:
  - Body and soul are both made of matter.
  - The soul is mortal: when the body dies, the soul dissolves; **no afterlife**.
- **Moral implication**:
  - Since there is no conscious afterlife, all good and bad must occur **in this life**, in our experiences.
  - This supports the idea that **death cannot be a harm** (no subject left to experience it).

### 1.2 Atheism (in the Epicurean sense)

- Epicurus says gods exist as **perfect, blessed, untroubled beings**, but:
  - They **do not create the world**.
  - They **do not reward or punish** humans.
  - They **do not intervene** in nature or human affairs.
- For practical purposes: **we should not fear the gods**.
- Moral implication:
  - No divine judgment, no hell, no cosmic punishment.
  - Religious fear is a major source of mental disturbance; eliminating it is essential for tranquility.

### 1.3 Hedonism

- **Hedonism**: Pleasure is the only intrinsic good; pain is the only intrinsic bad.
- Important Epicurean twist:
  - The **best kind of pleasure** is not intense stimulation, but a **stable state** of:
    - No bodily pain (**aponia**).
    - No mental disturbance or anxiety (**ataraxia**).
- Once we reach this painless, tranquil condition, we **need no further pleasure** to make life better.

## 2. How Best to Pursue Pleasure and the Absence of Pain

### 2.1 The Goal: Ataraxia and Aponia

- Best life = **freedom from pain in body** and **freedom from disturbance in mind**.
- Result: **ataraxia** – a calm, deeply peaceful, pleasantly content state.
- This is more valuable than chasing many short-lived, intense pleasures.

### 2.2 Strategy: Satisfy Basic Needs of Body and Mind

Epicurus’ central practical idea:

> Seek **simple, easily attainable pleasures** that secure freedom from pain and anxiety.

Key points:

1. **Desires fall into types**:
   - **Natural and necessary**  
     - For **life** (food, water, shelter).  
     - For **bodily health** (basic medical care, rest).  
     - For **happiness/peace of mind** (friendship, security, freedom from fear).
   - **Natural but not necessary**  
     - Extra variety and refinement (tasty food instead of plain, nice clothes, etc.).  
     - Pleasant, but not required for a good life.
   - **Groundless/empty**  
     - Desires for **fame, power, great wealth, luxury, status**, and limitless consumption.
     - These are culturally inflated and hard to satisfy.

2. **Practical rule**:
   - **Focus on natural and necessary desires**: they are **few and easy to satisfy**.
   - Be cautious about “natural but not necessary” desires.
   - **Reject or resist groundless desires**: they create constant frustration and anxiety.

3. **Self-sufficiency and simplicity**:
   - Getting used to **simple food, simple shelter, modest lifestyle**:
     - Makes you less dependent on luck and wealth.
     - Makes you **healthier** and more resilient.
     - Means occasional luxury is enjoyed more when it appears.
   - Example: Bread and water can be extremely pleasurable when you are truly hungry and free of fear.

4. **Prudence (practical reasoning)**:
   - We do **not** choose every pleasure, and we do **not** avoid every pain:
     - Sometimes **reject a pleasure** if it will cause greater pain later.
     - Sometimes **accept a pain** (e.g., medical treatment, hard work) if it leads to greater long-term tranquility.
   - This requires **calculating** long-term consequences.
   - Hence: living pleasantly **requires** living prudently, justly, and honorably; these virtues support stable pleasure.

5. **Is it really easy to satisfy basic needs?**
   - Epicurus claims: what is **natural** is generally easy to obtain.
   - But:
     - How easy basic needs are to satisfy depends heavily on your **social and economic conditions** (e.g., poverty, oppression, inequality).
     - Exam angle: you may be asked to question whether Epicurus underestimates these social factors.

## 3. Why Not Pursue Fame, Power, Wealth, and Luxuries?

Epicurus’ recommendation: **Do not aim your life at fame, political power, great wealth, or luxury.**

### 3.1 Main Reasons

1. **The pursuit itself is stressful and risky**:
   - Competing for power, status, and wealth brings:
     - Constant striving, fear of failure, political and social conflict.
     - Moral compromises that disturb your conscience.
   - This undermines ataraxia.

2. **Low chances of success; anxiety even if you succeed**:
   - Most people will **not** become famous or extremely wealthy.
   - Even if you do:
     - You worry about **losing** what you have.
     - You become dependent on external factors you cannot control (public opinion, markets, political shifts).

3. **You become “spoiled”**:
   - Luxuries raise your **baseline expectations**:
     - Ordinary experiences feel dull.
     - You **need more and more** to feel satisfied.
   - This contradicts the goal of being content with **little** and easily maintaining pleasure.

### 3.2 Exam Connection

You should be able to:

- Explain **why** Epicurus thinks these goals are irrational from a hedonist standpoint.
- Contrast:
  - A life of **simple sufficiency + tranquility** vs.
  - A life of **ambition and luxury** with constant anxiety.
- Reflect briefly on whether this advice might depend on:
  - How your society rewards or punishes non-ambitious lifestyles.

## 4. Friendship in Epicureanism

### 4.1 Why “Friendship is Golden”

Epicurus places **huge** value on friendship. Reasons:

1. **Pleasure and emotional support**:
   - Friends provide affection, companionship, and joy in everyday life.
   - They share your values and help calm fears about the future.

2. **Security and protection**:
   - Friends help you in times of need: illness, poverty, threats.
   - This reduces fear about the future and **increases ataraxia**.
   - In many cases, close friends provide **more reliable security** than any amount of money.

3. **Moral and psychological stability**:
   - Living among like-minded friends helps you maintain Epicurean attitudes and avoid social pressures toward wealth, status, and excess.
   - You cultivate trust and mutual care, which reinforces peace of mind.

### 4.2 Friendship vs. Wealth/Power

- Instead of competing for power and status, **invest in close, supportive friendships**.
- Epicurean “riches”: having what you truly need, plus reliable friends.
- Exam angle:
  - Be ready to explain why friendship is a **better long-term strategy** for happiness than wealth or fame.

### 4.3 Dependence on Culture?

- In some societies:
  - Strong community networks may make Epicurean friendship-based security more realistic.
- In others:
  - High mobility, individualism, and economic insecurity might make close, lasting friendships harder to attain.
- You may be asked to consider: **Does Epicurus’ optimism about friendship assume a certain kind of social environment?**

## 5. “Death is Nothing to Us”: Epicurus’ Argument

Epicurus’ famous claim: **“Death is nothing to us.”**

### 5.1 Core Argument

1. **All good and bad consist in sense-experience**  
   - Something can be bad for you only if you **experience it** as painful or unpleasant.
   - Likewise, something can be good only if you experience it as pleasurable.

2. **Death is the absence of all sense-experience**  
   - When you are dead, you do not feel anything: no pain, no fear, no regret.
   - Since the soul is material and dissolves at death (physicalism), there is **no conscious subject** after death.

3. **Therefore, death is not bad for the person who dies**  
   - When you exist, death is not present.  
   - When death is present, you do not exist.  
   - So there is **no time** at which both you and your death are present such that you can be harmed by it.
   - Thus, death is **“nothing to us”**—not an evil to the one who dies.

### 5.2 Reply to the “Missing Out” Objection

**Objection**: Even if death is not painful, it is bad because you will **miss out** on future pleasures you could have had.

Epicurean replies:

1. **No subject, no deprivation**:
   - To be deprived of something (like missed pleasures), you must **exist** to have that deprivation.
   - After death, you do not exist; so there is no “you” to be in a deprived state.

2. **Anticipatory fear is irrational**:
   - People often say they fear death not for the pain when it happens, but because thinking about future death now is painful.
   - Epicurus: it is irrational to let the thought of a state (death) that **will not be bad when it arrives** cause you distress now.
   - If being dead is not bad **when it happens**, then fearing it in advance is a **useless self-torment**.

3. **Focus on quality, not length, of life**:
   - A wise person does not cling to life at any cost nor rush toward death.
   - The goal is not to live as **long** as possible, but to live as **pleasantly and peacefully** as possible.
   - Once life is full of ataraxia, adding more years is not inherently better.

## 6. The Four-Part Cure (Tetrapharmakos)

Later Epicureans summarized Epicurus’ therapeutic strategy as a **“four-part cure”** for the soul’s main anxieties:

1. **Don’t fear the gods**  
   - They do not interfere with human affairs; no need to fear divine punishment or wrath.

2. **Don’t worry about death**  
   - Death is nothing to us: when death comes, we no longer exist to suffer.

3. **What is good is easy to obtain**  
   - True goods (basic bodily needs and tranquility of mind) require only simple, modest means.

4. **What is terrible is easy to endure**  
   - Extreme pains are usually short; long-lasting pains are tolerable or manageable.
   - With the right attitude and simple living, life’s hardships do not destroy happiness.

**Exam use**:  
- Explain how this “cure” connects:
  - To **physicalism and atheism** (no afterlife punishment, no interventions by gods).
  - To the **focus on basic needs** and simple pleasures.
  - To the argument that **death is nothing to us**.
