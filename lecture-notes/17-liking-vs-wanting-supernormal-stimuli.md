## 1. Liking vs Wanting: Concepts and Their Divergence

### Basic Distinction

- **Liking**
  - Subjective pleasure, enjoyment, hedonic feeling.
  - “How good it feels” when you do/consume something.
  - Often conscious and reportable: “I enjoy this,” “this tastes good.”

- **Wanting**
  - Motivation, urge, inclination to pursue or consume something.
  - Can operate without conscious reflection: craving, compulsion.
  - May persist even when you *know* you no longer enjoy the thing or judge it bad for you.

**Key Point:**  
They are **conceptually distinct**. It is logically possible, and empirically common, for wanting and liking to come apart.

### Ways They Diverge

1. **False Beliefs About Enjoyment**
   - You *believe* you like something (e.g., a prestigious job, social media use) because of habit, social expectations, or status.
   - On honest reflection, you realize you don’t actually enjoy it very much.
   - Your **beliefs** about liking can misalign with your **actual experience** of liking.

2. **Wanting Without Liking**
   - You have a **strong urge** to do X but:
     - X is not particularly pleasurable anymore, or
     - You might even find X aversive or empty.
   - Typical in addiction and compulsive behaviors.

3. **Liking Without Wanting**
   - You enjoy something when you do it, but don’t feel strong urges beforehand.
   - Example: You truly enjoy a quiet walk, reading, or visiting friends, but you rarely feel a powerful “pull” to initiate it compared with checking your phone.

## 2. Neuroscience of Wanting vs Liking

### Distinct Brain Systems

Current best-supported theories in neuroscience (especially “incentive salience” theory) hold:

- **Wanting system**
  - Centers: **mesolimbic dopamine system**, particularly:
    - Ventral tegmental area (VTA)
    - Nucleus accumbens (core)
    - Projections to prefrontal cortex and other limbic areas.
  - Key neurotransmitter: **dopamine**.
  - Function: tags stimuli and cues as “important” or “motivationally salient,” generating **cravings and pursuit**, not pleasure itself.

- **Liking system**
  - Centers: small **“hedonic hotspots”**:
    - Parts of the nucleus accumbens shell
    - Ventral pallidum
    - Other regions in brainstem and limbic system.
  - Neurochemicals: **opioids**, **endocannabinoids**, and certain **GABA** processes.
  - Function: generate **pleasurable feelings** and hedonic “liking” reactions.

### Evidence of Dissociation

- Animals can be manipulated so dopamine (wanting) is boosted while hedonic hotspots are unchanged:
  - They **work harder** for a reward (more wanting), but **facial expressions of pleasure** (liking) do not increase.
- Conversely, stimulating hedonic hotspots can increase liking reactions without creating strong motivated pursuit.

**Conclusion:**  
Motivation (wanting) and pleasure (liking) are realized in **partially separate brain systems**, using different circuits and neurotransmitters.

## 3. Drug Addiction as Misalignment of Wanting and Liking

### What Happens in Addiction?

1. **Sensitization of the Wanting System**
   - Repeated drug use causes **sensitization** of mesolimbic dopamine pathways.
   - Environmental cues associated with the drug (places, people, paraphernalia) come to trigger **intense dopamine “spikes”**.
   - Result: extremely strong **cravings and urges** when exposed to cues, even after long abstinence.

2. **Tolerance and Reduced Liking**
   - Over time, subjective pleasure (“high”) often **decreases**: the user no longer gets the same hedonic payoff.
   - They may say: “I don’t even enjoy it anymore, but I can’t stop.”
   - So:
     - **Wanting** (craving) can remain very high or increase.
     - **Liking** (pleasure) can stay constant or decline.

3. **Neural Mechanism of Misalignment**
   - **Wanting**: hyper-reactive dopamine system responds strongly to drug-related cues.
   - **Liking**: hedonic system adapts and may become less responsive; chronic use can disrupt normal hedonic function.
   - Thus the same behavior (taking the drug) is driven by a powerful **motivation system** that is **no longer tracking actual pleasure**.

### Addiction Beyond Drugs

- Similar patterns can occur with:
  - **Gambling** (especially slot machines, online betting)
  - **Junk food**
  - **Internet pornography**
  - **Certain video games**
- Common features:
  - Strong cue-triggered urges.
  - Declining or plateaued enjoyment.
  - Persistence of use despite recognition of harm.

## 4. Wanting vs Long-Term Well-Being and Values

Two levels of divergence:

1. **Wanting vs Liking (momentary pleasure)**
   - As above: we can crave things we no longer enjoy.

2. **Wanting vs What We Value / Long-Term Well-Being**
   - Even if we “like” something in the moment, we may judge that, over time, it **makes our life worse** (e.g., heavy social media use, binge-watching, junk food).
   - Philosophers like Harry Frankfurt emphasize:
     - We care not only about **what we want**, but also about **“what we want to want”** (our higher-order values).
   - The **attention economy**, as described by Jenny Odell and James Williams:
     - Uses persuasive design to keep us clicking, scrolling, and reacting.
     - Can **undermine our capacity for reflection and self-regulation**, making it harder “to want what we want to want.”
     - Leads to **short-term engagement** winning against **long-term aims** (meaningful work, relationships, political engagement, creativity).

**Exam-Relevant Idea:**  
Misalignment can thus be:
- Neural: wanting vs liking.
- Normative: wanting vs what we judge good for us or truly value over the long term.

## 5. Supernormal Stimuli: Definition and Core Idea

### Definition

A **supernormal stimulus** is:

> An **artificially exaggerated** version of a natural stimulus that a species evolved to respond to, which triggers a **stronger behavioral response** than the natural, “normal” stimulus.

Key features:

- Exploits **evolved preference mechanisms** (for certain shapes, colors, tastes, etc.).
- Is **more intense** (bigger, brighter, sweeter, more frequent) than anything typically found in the original environment of the species.
- Can cause the animal to **prefer the artificial stimulus** over the natural one, even when that is maladaptive.

### Why They Work

- Evolution shapes organisms to treat certain cues as reliable signs of fitness-relevant goods (food, mates, offspring).
- Supernormal stimuli **mimic and amplify** those cues.
- The evolved system **“over-fires”** in response: the animal wants it more than the thing that is actually good for survival or reproduction.

---

## 6. Examples of Supernormal Stimuli in Non-Human Animals

Know at least three clear examples:

1. **Birds Preferring Artificial “Eggs”**
   - Some birds will prefer to sit on **extra-large, more speckled, more colorful artificial eggs** over their own natural eggs.
   - The exaggerated size/color pattern overstimulates their built-in preference for “healthy” eggs.

2. **Herring Gull Chick Pecking Behavior**
   - Naturally, chicks peck at the **red spot** on their parent’s bill to get food.
   - In experiments, chicks peck even more at a **simple stick with three bright red stripes** than at the real bill.
   - The artificial cue is a **supernormal version** of the key visual feature (red contrast).

3. **Male Butterflies with Artificial Females**
   - Male butterflies can be attracted more strongly to **larger, brighter cardboard models** than to actual females.
   - Exaggeration of wing size and color intensity creates a supernormal sexual stimulus.

4. **Geese and Oversized Egg-Shaped Objects** (another common example)
   - Geese instinctively roll eggs back into their nest.
   - They will preferentially roll **larger egg-shaped objects** (e.g., a volleyball or fake oversized egg) over real eggs.
   - Again, bigger and more salient object triggers a stronger response.

**Common Pattern:**  
In each case, the animal’s **instinctive response system** treats an **exaggerated cue** as even more appealing than the real, fitness-supporting target.

## 7. Human Supernormal Stimuli: Candidates and Analysis

### General Idea

Modern technologies and industries create stimuli that:

- Are **more intense**, **more concentrated**, or **more frequent** than ancestral environments contained.
- Tap into evolved systems for:
  - Sugar, fat, and salt (food)
  - Sexual interest
  - Social approval and information
  - Novelty and uncertainty
- These can plausibly be seen as **supernormal stimuli** for humans.

For the exam, know at least two clear human examples and be able to:

- Argue why they count as supernormal.
- Discuss whether they involve:
  - Wanting vs liking divergence.
  - Urges that damage long-term well-being or values.

---

### Example 1: Highly Processed “Junk” Food

**Why it’s a supernormal stimulus**

- Our ancestors evolved in environments with **scarce sugar and fat**.
- Natural foods: moderate sweetness, fat, and salt.
- Modern processed foods are:
  - Extremely high in **sugar**, **refined carbohydrates**, **fat**, and **salt**.
  - Engineered for **hyper-palatability** (taste, texture, mouthfeel).
- Result: They present a **supernormal version** of the cues that once reliably signaled high-value calories.

**Wanting vs Liking**

- **Wanting:**
  - Strong cravings, especially in response to cues (smells, packaging, ads).
  - Dopamine response to sugar/fat and cues can sensitize with repeated consumption.
- **Liking:**
  - Initial consumption is pleasurable.
  - Over time, people often report **diminishing enjoyment** and even feeling sluggish or guilty, yet they continue to eat.
- So we can see:
  - **Wanting** may remain high or increase (craving).
  - **Liking** can plateau or decrease.

**Effect on Long-Term Well-Being**

- Frequent consumption is linked to:
  - Obesity, diabetes, heart disease.
  - Lower energy and health, possibly reduced mood.
- Thus, indulging the urge can **reduce overall well-being**, despite short-term pleasure and strong motivation.

---

### Example 2: Social Media and the Attention Economy

**Why it’s a supernormal stimulus**

- Humans evolved to care deeply about:
  - **Social approval**, reputation, group inclusion.
  - **New information** about threats and opportunities.
- Social media platforms (as described by Jenny Odell and others):
  - Provide **continuous, rapid, quantified feedback** (likes, comments, follower counts).
  - Use **persuasive design**: notification badges, red icons, intermittent variable rewards, infinite scroll.
  - Expose us to **constant novelty**, outrage-provoking news, and emotional content.
- This is a supernormal environment compared with the slow, small-scale social interactions of ancestral life:
  - Many more “social signals” per minute than we evolved for.
  - Amplified emotional triggers (fear, anger, envy, desire).

**Wanting vs Liking**

- **Wanting:**
  - Compulsive checking behaviors, especially upon seeing notifications or feeling bored or anxious.
  - Strong urge to refresh feeds, respond to notifications, and chase “engagement.”
- **Liking:**
  - People often report:
    - Brief hits of satisfaction when receiving likes or messages.
    - Overall feelings of **stress, anxiety, distraction, envy, or emptiness** after extended use.
- A user can feel:
  - “I keep reaching for my phone, but I don’t even like what I’m seeing.”
  - This is a classic **wanting > liking** pattern.

**Effect on Long-Term Well-Being and Values**

- As James Williams notes, persistent distraction can:
  - Prevent us from “living the lives we want to live.”
  - Undermine capacities for **reflection** and **self-regulation**, making it harder to “want what we want to want.”
- As Odell emphasizes:
  - The attention economy can trap people in **waves of hysteria, fear, and outrage**, generating anxiety while making it hard to think clearly or act effectively.
- Long-term costs can include:
  - Reduced ability to concentrate.
  - Neglect of meaningful relationships and projects.
  - Distorted sense of reality and values.
- So social media can be:
  - A **supernormal social stimulus** (exaggerated friendship/attention/novelty).
  - A case where we frequently **want** to engage, often **don’t deeply like** the experience, and **harm long-term well-being** and autonomy.

---

### Example 3: Internet Pornography

**Why it’s a supernormal stimulus**

- Humans evolved sexual interest for:
  - Real partners, with limited variety and frequency.
- Internet pornography:
  - Offers **endless variety** of bodies and scenarios (novelty).
  - Extremely convenient, available on demand.
  - Intensifies visual and sexual cues beyond what is typical in ordinary life.
- This creates a **supernormal sexual environment**, far beyond ancestral conditions.

**Wanting vs Liking**

- **Wanting:**
  - Strong urges or compulsive use, especially with certain cues (boredom, stress, loneliness).
- **Liking:**
  - Pleasure during use, but some report:
    - Diminished satisfaction over time.
    - Desensitization to normal sexual interaction.
    - Feelings of emptiness or shame afterward.
- Thus, as with drugs, we can see **rising or stable wanting with declining liking**.

**Effect on Long-Term Well-Being**

- Potential consequences:
  - Interference with real-life intimacy.
  - Unrealistic expectations about sex and bodies.
  - In some cases, decreased motivation for relationships and other life projects.
- Again, urges can lead to behavior that **undermines valued aspects** of life and relationships.

---

### Example 4: Gambling and Slot Machines (Optional Additional Example)

- Slot machines and online gambling use:
  - **Intermittent variable rewards** (like the notification schedule on social media).
  - Bright colors, sounds, near-misses: all designed to exaggerate reward cues.
- This creates a **supernormal reward environment** for systems evolved for occasional, natural wins.
- Clear case of:
  - Strong **dopamine-driven wanting**.
  - Liking that often declines.
  - Severe **long-term harm** (financial ruin, stress, social damage).

---

## 8. Supernormal Stimuli and Wanting–Liking Divergence in Humans

### Do Supernormal Stimuli Create Wanting–Liking Divergences?

Often, yes:

- By **over-activating** our motivational systems (dopamine and related circuitry), they:
  - Increase **wanting** and cue-triggered urges.
- But because of:
  - Tolerance.
  - Desensitization.
  - Conflicts with our values and self-image.
- They often **do not increase liking indefinitely** and may even decrease the real enjoyment or meaning of the activity.

### Do They Reduce Long-Term Well-Being or Other Values?

Common patterns across human cases:

- **Short-term:**
  - Intense motivation and quick gratifications.
- **Long-term:**
  - Health problems (junk food).
  - Attention fragmentation and anxiety (social media).
  - Relationship and sexual difficulties (porn).
  - Financial and psychological damage (gambling).

These are paradigmatic cases of:

1. **Wanting > Liking**  
   We pursue something more than we actually enjoy it.

2. **Wanting vs What We Value**  
   Our immediate urges conflict with:
   - Our long-term interests.
   - Our reflective judgments about the kind of life we want to live.

## 9. How to Use These Ideas in an Exam Answer

When asked about these topics, be sure you can:

1. **Define and distinguish liking vs wanting**
   - Liking = pleasure; wanting = motivation/urge.
   - Explain that they are conceptually distinct and can diverge.

2. **Describe the neuroscientific basis**
   - Wanting: mesolimbic dopamine system.
   - Liking: hedonic hotspots with opioids/endocannabinoids.
   - Emphasize different circuits and neurochemicals.

3. **Explain addiction through this lens**
   - Sensitized wanting system; tolerance in liking.
   - Addict may strongly want a drug they no longer enjoy and judge as bad.

4. **Define supernormal stimulus**
   - Artificially exaggerated natural cue causing stronger response than the natural stimulus.
   - Explain why evolution makes us vulnerable to these.

5. **Give at least three animal examples**
   - Birds preferring large/artificial eggs.
   - Herring gull chicks preferring a red-striped stick.
   - Male butterflies preferring larger/brighter models.
   - (Optionally: geese and oversized egg-shaped objects.)

6. **Give at least two human examples and analyze**
   - Junk food, social media, porn, gambling.
   - For each: say why it is supernormal; discuss wanting vs liking; discuss impact on long-term well-being and values.

7. **Connect to the attention economy readings**
   - Persuasive design as engineering supernormal stimuli for attention.
   - Connection to James Williams’ point about undermining our ability to “want what we want to want.”
   - Odell’s emphasis on the need to withdraw or resist in order to regain meaningful, self-directed attention.

These elements together will let you answer questions about:

- The difference between wanting and liking in neuroscience.
- How this explains addiction.
- What supernormal stimuli are in animals and humans.
- How they can produce both **neural** misalignments (wanting vs liking) and **normative** misalignments (urge vs long-term well-being and values).
