## Zhuangzi: Virtues and Vices in Daoism

### 1. Practice and “Knack”: The Wheelwright

- Wheelwright story (summary idea):
  - An old wheelwright tells a bookish noble that written words are just the “leftovers” of the sages.
  - Real skill (like making a good wheel) cannot be fully taught by words or rules.
  - You must practice until you develop a *knack* — an embodied, intuitive responsiveness.

**Implication for Daoist virtue:**

- Living in harmony with the Dao is like wheel-making:
  - Not rule-following, but *skilled responsiveness* to changing situations.
  - Virtues are practical abilities cultivated through life, not abstract principles memorized from texts.

### 2. Core Virtues in Zhuangzi

All these support moving with the Dao in a changing, uncertain world.

#### a. Openness

- **What it is**:
  - Willingness to see from multiple perspectives.
  - Not clinging to one fixed view of what is right, good, or real.
- **Textual basis (ideas)**:
  - Different beings “know” different things as right (eels, people, birds, deer each find different foods, homes, mates “right”).
  - “Each thing is right in its own way”; the sage lets many perspectives be valid.
- **Role in happiness**:
  - Reduces dogmatism and conflict.
  - Makes it easier to accept others and oneself in changing roles and circumstances.

#### b. Adaptability

- **What it is**:
  - Ability to shift easily as situations change.
  - Willingness to let judgments, plans, and even self-conceptions adjust.
- **Textual basis (ideas)**:
  - “Courses are formed by someone walking them”: paths and norms are made by use, not fixed in advance.
  - The sage “walks two roads”: can switch between different “rights and wrongs” to harmonize with others while remaining inwardly at ease.
- **Role in happiness**:
  - Helps one cope with unpredictable events (loss, failure, illness).
  - Prevents getting “stuck” in outdated roles or expectations.

#### c. Spontaneity

- **What it is**:
  - Unforced, natural, flexible responsiveness — like a skilled musician improvising.
  - Acting without overthinking, once the knack is internalized.
- **Textual basis (ideas)**:
  - The wind blowing through many hollows creates many different tones automatically.
  - The sage “lets things be so of themselves” rather than forcing rigid plans.
- **Role in happiness**:
  - Less anxiety and over-calculation.
  - Actions feel effortless and fitting, like “going with the flow.”

#### d. Attentiveness

- **What it is**:
  - Careful, present-moment noticing of subtle details: context, timing, other people’s needs.
  - Awareness of how things are actually changing rather than how we wish they were.
- **Textual basis (ideas)**:
  - The sage “goes by the rightness of the present ‘this’”: decides based on the concrete situation before them.
  - The “Illumination of the Obvious” means clearly seeing how every “this” is also a “that” from another viewpoint.
- **Role in happiness**:
  - Prevents clumsy, inappropriate actions.
  - Makes it possible to be spontaneous *and* wise, because the spontaneity is well-informed.

### 3. Central Vices in Zhuangzi

These are obstacles to harmonizing with the Dao.

#### a. Rigidity

- **What it is**:
  - Clinging to one set of beliefs, rules, or identities as absolutely right.
  - Insisting there is one correct way things must be.
- **Textual basis (ideas)**:
  - Zhuangzi mocks those who “shoot forth like an arrow” to judge right and wrong, and “hold fast as if to sworn oaths.”
  - Confucians and Mohists each insist their doctrine is *the* correct one, endlessly debating.
- **Why it’s bad**:
  - The world is too complex and changing for one rigid standard.
  - Leads to conflict, self-torment, and inability to adapt when circumstances shift.

#### b. Being Stuck or Blocked

- **What it is**:
  - Being trapped in one role, agenda, or emotional state.
  - Continuing along the same “ruts” even when they no longer work.
- **Textual basis (ideas)**:
  - People “drown in their own activities, unable to turn back.”
  - Zhao Wen’s son spends his life trying to master his father’s zither technique, never moving beyond.
- **Why it’s bad**:
  - Wastes life chasing narrow projects or reputations.
  - Prevents growth and transformation.

#### c. Inattentiveness

- **What it is**:
  - Not really seeing what’s happening now; being lost in fixed concepts or worries.
- **Textual basis (ideas)**:
  - Endless debates leave “something unseen”; people argue theories instead of seeing the present situation.
  - To “labor your spirit” trying to unify all things is called “Three in the Morning”: you miss that 3+4 and 4+3 are the same.
- **Why it’s bad**:
  - Leads to foolish emotional reactions (like the monkeys angry at 3/4 but happy at 4/3).
  - Stops you from acting well in the actual moment you are living.

## Zhuangzi: Embracing Uncertainty, Change, and Transformation

### 1. Uncertainty as Fundamental

#### a. Pervasive Uncertainty

- Humans are naturally unsure about:
  - What is truly right or wrong.
  - What will happen to them and the world.
  - Even what the “self” is.
- Zhuangzi stresses:
  - Our judgments of right/wrong depend on perspective (“this” vs. “that”).
  - What counts as beautiful, useful, or good varies by species, culture, and situation.

**Key idea**: There is no single, final, context-free standpoint from which to judge everything.

#### b. The Sage’s Attitude: “Radiance of Drift and Doubt”

- The sage:
  - Does *not* decisively fix what is right once and for all.
  - Instead uses the “Radiance of Drift and Doubt” — a clear, relaxed awareness that things are always shifting.
  - Does not “define what is right,” but trusts the “everyday function” of each being (what actually works for it).
- This is not lazy relativism; it is:
  - Careful attention to concrete cases.
  - Refusal to absolutize any single perspective.

#### c. “Illumination of the Obvious” and “Present This”

- “Illumination of the Obvious”:
  - Seeing how every viewpoint is both right and limited.
  - Understanding that “this” only makes sense against some “that,” and vice versa.
- “Going by the rightness of the present ‘this’”:
  - Instead of chasing final certainty, respond wisely to *this* specific situation now.
  - Deep uncertainty at the grand level, but clear responsiveness in the immediate.

**Result**: Peaceful *epistemic humility* — calmness in not knowing everything, combined with practical skill in action.

---

### 2. Embracing Change and Transformation

#### a. Self as Process, Not Fixed Thing

- Imagery of the wind:
  - A great breath blows through many hollows; each produces different sounds.
  - Similarly, the Dao flows through beings, producing many forms and personalities.
- Ziqi says he has “lost me”:
  - The rigid, separate “I” dissolves into a more open awareness.
  - We are shifting patterns in a larger process, not solid, isolated selves.

#### b. Life and Death as Transformations

- Stories and images:
  - Lady Li cries when captured, but later rejoices in the king’s palace and regrets her earlier distress — perspective changes completely.
  - Dream images: dreaming of drinking wine vs. weeping, then waking; a “great awakening” might show our current life as just a dream.
  - Butterfly dream: Zhuang Zhou dreams he is a butterfly; on waking, he cannot tell if he was Zhou dreaming he was a butterfly, or a butterfly now dreaming it is Zhou.
- Core thought:
  - Boundaries between states (life/death, waking/dream, human/animal) are not absolute.
  - Our strong attachments to one state (“life,” “being human,” this particular identity) are partly based on narrow perspective.

#### c. Recommended Attitude

- Do **not**:
  - Cling desperately to any particular identity, role, or condition.
  - Treat death as an absolute catastrophe or life as an absolute possession.
- Do:
  - Treat transformations as natural transitions in the Dao.
  - Remain flexible and curious: “How do I know that loving life is not a delusion? How do I know the dead do not regret having clung to life?”
- For happiness:
  - Reduces fear of future change (aging, illness, death).
  - Encourages savoring of the present configuration while being ready to flow into the next.

## Self and Role: Sincerity, Authenticity, and Genuine Pretending in the Zhuangzi

Zhuangzi is very interested in **how** we inhabit roles (parent, student, official, friend) in a changing world. Three contrasting models:

---

### 1. Sincerity

*(Think: Confucian ideal.)*

#### a. What Sincerity Is

- You:
  - Wholeheartedly **identify** with your social/moral roles (child, ruler, friend, etc.).
  - Try to make your inner feelings perfectly match the moral norms of the role.
  - Want to *really be* a filial child, loyal minister, benevolent ruler, etc.
- “Genuineness” here:
  - Being inwardly exactly what your role demands.
  - Little or no gap between inner self and outer performance.

#### b. Problems from Zhuangzi’s Perspective

- Encourages **rigidity**:
  - You lock onto a specific, role-defined identity and moral code.
  - Hard to accept other perspectives or roles that conflict with your chosen one.
- Makes you vulnerable to **change**:
  - If you lose the role (fired, exiled, retired), your sense of self collapses.
- Strengthens **harsh judgments**:
  - Sincere defenders of their roles often insist that their way of living is simply right, other ways are wrong.
  - This leads to endless debates, conflicts, and moralistic anxiety.

**Conclusion**: Zhuangzi is suspicious of sincerity as an absolute ideal. It tends toward the vices of rigidity and stuckness.

---

### 2. Authenticity

*(Think: modern Western ideal.)*

#### a. What Authenticity Is

- You:
  - Seek to discover your “true inner self” — your unique, deep identity.
  - Aim to live in a way that expresses this inner essence, even against social expectations.
  - Often view social roles as masks or constraints that must not distort your true self.
- “Genuineness” here:
  - Being faithful to your inner essence, not letting society define you.

#### b. Problems from Zhuangzi’s Perspective

- Still assumes a **fixed core self**:
  - A stable inner essence you must discover and protect.
  - This clashes with Zhuangzi’s vision of self as fluid and transforming.
- Can become a new kind of **rigidity**:
  - “I *am* this kind of person, therefore I must always act this way.”
  - Anxiety about “Am I really being my true self?” creates inner conflict.
- Can damage **harmony with others**:
  - Overemphasis on self-expression may make it hard to adapt kindly to family, workplace, or community needs.

**Conclusion**: Authenticity is less focused on fixed roles and moral codes than sincerity, but still too focused on a fixed self. It doesn’t fit well with Zhuangzi’s emphasis on transformation and perspective-shifting.

---

### 3. Genuine Pretending (Zhuangzi’s Recommended Ideal)

“Genuine pretending” is a helpful modern term for Zhuangzi’s preferred way of being in roles.

#### a. What Genuine Pretending Is

- **Pretending**:
  - You fully *play* your social roles (parent, teacher, friend, official) — like an excellent actor.
  - You take them seriously enough to do them well and responsibly.
  - But you remain aware that they are *roles*, not absolute identities.
- **Genuine**:
  - You are not lying or faking in a deceptive way.
  - Your responses in the role are sincerely caring and appropriate to the situation.
  - Your genuineness lies in *attunement to the moment*, not in expressing a fixed inner essence.

**Key point**: You neither cling to roles as your true self (sincerity), nor cling to a hidden inner essence behind roles (authenticity). You skillfully *inhabit* roles, knowing they are temporary configurations of the Dao.

#### b. Features of Genuine Pretending

Connects directly to Daoist virtues:

- **Openness**:
  - You are open to many possible identities and perspectives.
  - You see that each role is one way the Dao flows through you for a while.
- **Adaptability**:
  - You can move flexibly among different roles as life changes (child → parent, student → worker, etc.).
  - You adjust behavior to the needs of each relationship without inner crisis.
- **Spontaneity**:
  - Like a good improviser, you respond creatively to each new situation within the role.
  - Not rigidly following a script, but letting the role express itself appropriately in changing conditions.
- **Attentiveness**:
  - You carefully read the “rightness of the present this”:
    - What does this child, this colleague, this stranger need *now*?
  - You are sensitive to context rather than trapped in abstract rules.

#### c. How Zhuangzi’s Text Supports Genuine Pretending

- The sage “uses various rights and wrongs to harmonize with others” while resting in the center (Heaven’s Potter’s Wheel).
  - Outwardly: can speak and act in many different moral languages and roles.
  - Inwardly: not bound by any single fixed identity.
- The sage treats “each thing as right” and “enfolds them all within himself.”
  - Can affirm many forms of life, many roles and perspectives.
- Advice to “forget what year it is, forget what should or should not be; let yourself be jostled and shaken by the boundlessness.”
  - Let go of fixed stories about who you must be.
  - Allow roles and identities to shift with circumstances.

#### d. Why Genuine Pretending is Recommended over Sincerity and Authenticity

1. **Handles Uncertainty Better**
   - No need for final certainty about who you “really” are or which moral code is absolutely right.
   - You navigate uncertainty by skilled, context-sensitive responding.

2. **Handles Change and Transformation Better**
   - Roles and identities can come and go without destroying your sense of self.
   - You see yourself more like Zhuang Zhou/the butterfly: multiple forms over time.

3. **Avoids Main Vices**
   - Less prone to rigidity:
     - You don’t absolutize roles (sincerity) or inner essence (authenticity).
   - Less likely to get stuck:
     - If a role no longer fits, you can gracefully move to another.
   - Increases attentiveness:
     - Focus shifts from “Am I being true to *myself*?” to “What is right for *this situation*?”

4. **Promotes Harmony and Happiness**
   - Easier to get along with diverse people and norms: you can “walk two roads.”
   - Anxiety about self-justification and moral purity decreases.
   - You live more lightly and playfully, yet still responsibly.

### 4. Quick Comparison Table

| Model          | What is “real” self?              | Attitude to roles              | Zhuangzi’s verdict |
|----------------|-----------------------------------|--------------------------------|--------------------|
| Sincerity      | My role-defined moral identity    | Be *truly* and fully my role   | Too rigid, role-bound |
| Authenticity   | Inner essence behind roles        | Roles may be masks            | Still too essentialist |
| Genuine pretending | No fixed essence; shifting patterns in Dao | Fully play roles, knowing they’re provisional | Recommended ideal |

**For the exam**: 

- Be able to:
  - Define the four virtues and three vices and explain how they relate to living with the Dao.
  - Explain how Zhuangzi embraces uncertainty and change (perspectivism, dreams, transformation).
  - Distinguish sincerity, authenticity, and genuine pretending, and give reasons why genuine pretending best fits Zhuangzi’s philosophy.
