## Zhuangzi: Virtues and Vices in Daoism

### General picture

- **Dao (the Way)**: the natural, ever-changing flow of the world.
- **Human problem**: we cling to fixed views, roles, and plans; this makes us rigid, anxious, and out of sync with the Dao.
- **Solution**: cultivate certain *virtues* (dispositions or skills) that let us move with the Dao, and avoid certain *vices* that block us.

### The Wheelwright story (key background)

- An old wheelwright sees a ruler reading “the books of the sages”.
- He says:
  - His *own* craft (making wheels) depends on a **knack**:
    - If he carves too slowly → wheel is brittle.
    - Too fast → wheel is spongy.
    - Just right → “it fits hand and heart”.
  - This knack:
    - Cannot be fully put into words.
    - Cannot be transmitted just by explanation.
    - Exists as a lived, embodied **skill**.
- His punchline about the classics:
  - What the sages really knew **died with them**.
  - Their books are just “dregs” of that living understanding.
- Lesson:
  - **Words and rules alone can’t teach you how to live well.**
  - You must *practice* living in harmony with the Dao until you develop a flexible, responsive **knack**.

This same idea underlies Daoist **virtues** and **genuine pretending**: the point is not to follow explicit rules, but to cultivate fluid, skillful responsiveness.

### Virtues in Zhuangzi

These are traits that help you attune to the Dao.

#### 1. Openness

- **What it is**:
  - Willingness to see from multiple perspectives; not locking into one “this is absolutely right” standpoint.
- **Textual support**:
  - “Illumination of the Obvious”: the sage recognizes that **“this” and “that”** (right/wrong, mine/yours) arise from particular standpoints.
  - The sage “lets them all bask in the broad daylight of Heaven” instead of clinging to one side.
- **Function**:
  - Makes you receptive to how things actually are **now**, rather than forcing reality into your preconceptions.
  - Basis for tolerance: “each thing is just so, each thing is right” from its own perspective.

#### 2. Adaptability

- **What it is**:
  - Ability to shift views, plans, and roles as situations change.
- **Examples**:
  - **Monkey/Chestnut story (“three in the morning”)**:
    - Trainer: “3 chestnuts in the morning, 4 at night.”
    - Monkeys angry.
    - Trainer: “Fine: 4 in the morning, 3 at night.”
    - Monkeys delighted.
    - Nothing *really* changed, but he flexibly adjusted to their current standpoint (“the rightness of their present ‘this’”).
  - **Sage “walking two roads”**:
    - Uses varying “rights and wrongs” to harmonize with people.
    - Yet stays “at rest in the middle of Heaven’s potter’s wheel” (keeps an inner center while adapting outwardly).
- **Function**:
  - Lets you live effectively in a world where values and perspectives constantly shift.
  - Opposite of stubbornness about one correct way.

#### 3. Spontaneity

- **What it is**:
  - Natural, unforced responsiveness; acting from a deeply trained knack rather than from tight, self-conscious control.
- **Connection to Wheelwright**:
  - The wheelwright’s cutting is not calculated step-by-step; it flows from “hand and heart”.
  - This is **trained spontaneity**: practice + letting go of rigidity.
- **Connection to Ziqi “losing me”**:
  - Ziqi says he has **“lost me”**:
    - He no longer clings to a fixed, controlling ego.
    - He is moved by the “piping of Heaven” (the natural processes that blow through “the ten thousand differences”).
- **Function**:
  - Prevents overthinking.
  - Allows alignment with the Dao as it manifests *right now*.

#### 4. Attentiveness

- **What it is**:
  - Sharp awareness of subtle changes in self, others, and environment.
- **Examples**:
  - Listening to the **“piping of Heaven”**:
    - The wind blows through different hollows; each hollow gives a distinct sound.
    - Attentiveness = hearing the specific situation rather than imposing one sound on all.
  - Stories about dream/awakening:
    - Recognizing how different states (dreaming/waking, life/death, joy/sorrow) arise and pass.
- **Function**:
  - Makes you responsive instead of automatic.
  - Enables openness and adaptability: you can’t adjust well if you don’t perceive what’s actually happening.

### Vices in Zhuangzi

These are patterns that block harmony with the Dao.

#### 1. Rigidity

- **What it is**:
  - Insisting on one fixed doctrine, one identity, one way of life, or one “true” right/wrong.
- **Examples**:
  - Debaters (Confucians vs Mohists) each claim to own “right” and “wrong”.
  - Zhuangzi shows any position can be affirmed or denied from some standpoint.
- **Why it’s a vice**:
  - The world is constantly changing; rigid stances soon conflict with reality.
  - Leads to dogmatism, conflict, and inner tension.

#### 2. Being Stuck or Blocked

- **What it is**:
  - Getting trapped in one role, mood, or self-conception; inability to move on.
- **Examples**:
  - People “continue along the same ruts… held fast as if bound by cords.”
  - Zhao Wen’s son endlessly grappling with his father’s zither strings, never moving beyond that narrow skill.
- **Why it’s a vice**:
  - Blocks transformation of self and perspective.
  - Makes you brittle and unable to cope with new situations.

#### 3. Inattentiveness

- **What it is**:
  - Moving through life on autopilot; not noticing how all things and evaluations are constantly shifting.
- **Examples**:
  - People spend life “drowning in their own activities,” never asking what any of it amounts to.
  - Fools assume they are “already awake” to reality, not seeing they’re in a “vast dream”.
- **Why it’s a vice**:
  - You miss chances to adapt.
  - You cling to illusions about yourself, others, and what really matters.

## Embracing Uncertainty, Change, and Transformation

### 1. Uncertainty

#### Basic claim

- **Uncertainty about the future and our place in the world is built into human life.**
- Zhuangzi does **not** try to remove this uncertainty; instead, he teaches how to live *well within it*.

#### Relativity of right and wrong

- “This” and “that”, “right” and “wrong”:
  - Are generated together from particular standpoints.
  - From one perspective, X is right; from another, X is wrong.
- Examples:
  - Different animals “know” different right foods, right habitats, right beauty.
  - Humans prefer certain foods, homes, lovers; fish, birds, deer have totally different standards.
- Conclusion:
  - There is no single, final, objective standard accessible to us that settles all disputes.
  - Our words and arguments are inherently limited and “obscured”.

#### Zhuangzi’s response: “Radiance of Drift and Doubt”

- The sage’s only “map” is the **Radiance of Drift and Doubt**:
  - Drift: letting viewpoints and situations flow, not freezing them.
  - Doubt: not clinging dogmatically to any single fixed judgment.
- The sage:
  - “Goes by the rightness of the present ‘this’.”
  - Entrusts judgments to the **“everyday function of each thing”**:
    - What works for *this* being in *this* context.
- This is *not* nihilism:
  - He still acts, speaks, and cares.
  - But he does so with humility about his own standpoint.

---

### 2. Change and Transformation

#### Fundamental idea

- The world, our circumstances, and we ourselves are in **constant transformation**.
- Zhuangzi urges us to **embrace** this, including:
  - Changes in fortune.
  - Aging and disease.
  - Death.

#### Key stories and arguments

1. **Ziqi “losing me”**
   - Ziqi says he has “lost me”:
     - His rigid, ego-centered self has dissolved.
     - He is like a hollow that wind passes through: the “piping of Heaven” produces many sounds.
   - Suggests:
     - The self is not a fixed substance but part of a larger process (“Great Clump” of qi).
     - Openness to transformation of self.

2. **Life as dream; dream as life**
   - You can dream you drink wine and wake up weeping; or dream weeping and wake up joyful.
   - “While dreaming, you don’t know it’s a dream.”
   - Zhuangzi:
     - Asks if a **“great awakening”** would make our whole present life look like a dream.
     - Claims that Confucius and the questioner are dreaming; even his own statement is within the dream.
   - Lesson:
     - Our current certainties about what is real, important, or tragic may later look as mistaken as dream-fears.
     - This undercuts obsessive clinging to particular states of life.

3. **Butterfly dream**
   - Zhuang Zhou dreams he is a butterfly, carefree.
   - Wakes as Zhuang Zhou again.
   - He doesn’t know:
     - Whether he was Zhuang Zhou dreaming a butterfly,
     - or a butterfly now dreaming he is Zhuang Zhou.
   - Calls this the **“transformation of one thing into another.”**
   - Lesson:
     - Identity is fluid; the boundary between “me” and “not me” is not as strict as we think.
     - We should not cling to one fixed self as ultimately real.

4. **Lady Li**
   - Lady Li wept when taken from her old life to Qin.
   - When she later enjoyed palace luxury, she regretted her earlier tears.
   - Zhuangzi:
     - Asks whether the dead may similarly regret how tightly they clung to life.
   - Lesson:
     - Our present judgments about what is good/bad (life/death, place/status) are unstable and may be overturned by later transformations.

#### How to embrace transformation

- “Harmonize with them by means of their Heavenly Transitions”:
  - Recognize that every “so” is also “not-so,” every “right” also “not-right,” in some context.
  - Don’t try to force all things into one permanent pattern.
- “Forget what year it is, forget what should or should not be”:
  - Drop obsessive calendar- and duty-fixation.
  - Live in the present flow, rather than in abstract schemes.
- Sage’s posture:
  - “Standing shoulder to shoulder with the sun and moon, scooping up time and space.”
  - Participates in many different “harvests”, yet tastes the same underlying “maturation” in all.
  - Even death/life cannot fundamentally disturb him.

## Sincerity, Authenticity, Genuine Pretending – and Zhuangzi’s Recommendation

This section is about **how to understand the self and its roles**.

### 1. Definitions

#### Sincerity

(Think roughly: *inner consistency and earnestness about accepted norms or roles*.)

- You:
  - Deeply internalize certain values/roles (e.g., “dutiful son,” “loyal minister”, “moral person”).
  - Strive to align your thoughts, feelings, and actions with those norms.
  - Avoid hypocrisy: you want your **inner** and **outer** to match.
- Ideal in many Confucian texts:
  - One should *truly* embody one’s role, not just go through the motions.

#### Authenticity

(Think roughly: *being true to an inner, unique, “real self” that is prior to roles*.)

- You:
  - Believe you have a deep, stable core self with its own desires, values, identity.
  - Try to express this inner self outwardly, even if it conflicts with social expectations.
  - Often involves suspicion of social roles as “masks” that distort your real essence.
- Ideal in much modern Western thought:
  - “Be yourself,” “find your true self,” “don’t just conform.”

#### Genuine Pretending

(Concept used by some interpreters to capture Zhuangzi’s view.)

- You:
  - Fully and skillfully play your social roles (child, student, friend, worker, etc.).
  - Do so with **wholehearted engagement**, but with an important awareness:
    - You know that no role or self-description is **ultimately, absolutely “you”**.
    - Roles are tools or costumes that you can change as circumstances change.
- “Pretending”:
  - Because roles are not your fixed essence.
- “Genuine”:
  - Because you are not deceptive or half-hearted; you throw yourself into the role *for now*, while knowing it’s not ultimate.
- Fits Zhuangzi’s idea of:
  - “Walking two roads” (both engaging and stepping back).
  - Letting each “this” be right in its context, without freezing it as absolute.

---

### 2. Zhuangzi’s critique of sincerity and authenticity

#### Problems with rigid sincerity

- When sincerity is tied to **one fixed set of norms or one dao**:
  - You cling to one moral scheme as *the* truth (e.g., only one way of being filial, loyal, just).
  - You become **rigid** and unable to adapt to different situations or people.
- Zhuangzi’s targets:
  - Confucians and Mohists who insist on their own “right” and denounce others’ as “wrong.”
  - People who “follow whatever has so far taken shape in their minds, making that their teacher.”
- Consequences:
  - “Continue along the same ruts,” exhausted and bewildered.
  - Constant disputes over right/wrong with no final resolution.
- From a Daoist standpoint:
  - Such sincerity is a **vice** because it opposes openness and adaptability.
  - It ties your identity tightly to one pattern, making change and uncertainty terrifying.

#### Problems with authenticity (in the Western sense)

- Authenticity assumes:
  - There is a **stable, deep “true self”** you should discover and express.
  - Social roles are often false impositions that hide this true self.
- Zhuangzi’s view of self clashes with this:
  - The self is **fluid and interdependent**, not a fixed core:
    - Ziqi “loses me”.
    - Butterfly dream blurs boundary between “Zhuang Zhou” and “butterfly”.
    - Body and mind are just configurations of qi that transform.
  - Our identities and preferences themselves are products of changing circumstances:
    - Lady Li’s reversal of feelings about her life situation.
- Thus, a project of “finding and expressing the one, final true self”:
  - Misunderstands what a self is.
  - Risks making you cling to yet another **rigid story** about who you “really” are.
  - Conflict with Daoist embrace of constant transformation.

---

### 3. Why Genuine Pretending fits Zhuangzi

#### How it works

- You accept that:
  - Roles and identities are **necessary**: we can’t live without them.
  - But they are also **contingent and changing**: none is ultimately “who you are” forever.
- So you:
  - Take on roles as they arise (student, friend, child, worker).
  - Perform them **skilfully and wholeheartedly** (like the wheelwright’s practiced knack).
  - Stay **internally light and flexible**:
    - You don’t absolutize any role.
    - You let roles transform as situations change.
- This matches:
  - The sage “harmonizing with others” through varying rights/wrongs while remaining at rest in the middle.
  - “Harmonizing with Heavenly Transitions” and “being jostled and shaken by the boundlessness, yet lodged securely in it.”
  - Going by “the rightness of the present ‘this’” instead of defending one constant identity.

#### Connection to the virtues

- **Openness**:
  - Genuine pretending recognizes many legitimate ways of being; you can seriously inhabit different roles without claiming any as the only true one.
- **Adaptability**:
  - You can step into and out of roles as the context changes (like the monkey-trainer’s chestnut counts).
- **Spontaneity**:
  - Once you have practiced roles and skills, you can perform them effortlessly, without overthinking.
- **Attentiveness**:
  - You watch for what this situation calls for, rather than mechanically replaying a role-script.

#### Why Zhuangzi recommends genuine pretending

- It:
  - Respects the **inescapable reality of roles** (you still act, talk, form relationships).
  - Avoids the **rigidity of sincerity** (no single fixed dao or identity is treated as absolute).
  - Avoids the **illusion of a fixed authentic core** (self is recognized as transformable).
  - Allows you to live **happily and skillfully within uncertainty and change**.
- In short:
  - Zhuangzi’s ideal is not “be absolutely sincere” or “express a true inner self,”
  - But to **play your changing roles genuinely, while knowing they are only roles**—this is genuine pretending.
